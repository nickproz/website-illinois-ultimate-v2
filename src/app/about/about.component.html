<h1 class="ui header">About Us</h1>
<p>Illinois Ultimate is one of the premier ultimate programs in the Midwest and frequently ranks in the National top 25. We strive to contend with the best programs in the country and qualify to compete at Nationals regulary. We are a program that prides itself on developing players who come to Illinois with no experience playing competitive ultimate. We teach all levels of ultimate, from the basics of throwing a forehand all the way to throwing bombs in the worst of weather.</p>
<h2 class="ui header">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>We want to compete at the highest level possible in college ultimate while remaining respectful to our opponents.  We want to develop all our of players to become the best they can be at ultimate, as well as players who exemplify the true meaning of sportsmanship, which is pivotal to the progress of ultimate frisbee in its current state.</p>
<h2 class="ui header">Team Structure/Affiliation with University</h2>
<p>Our team is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at the University of Illinois and we are classified as a club sport. We receive some funding from the University that helps pay for our travel costs and hotels while we are at tournaments.</p>
<p>We are a member of the USAU  College Series and compete in a series of tournaments that  culminate in the College Championships held every year during Memorial Day weekend. Most, if not all, state schools have established ultimate teams and many smaller schools have teams as well.  We compete in the Illinois conference which is as you can guess, the schools in the state of Illinois. The next largest division is the Great Lakes Region, which includes the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Kentucky. The final step is the aforementioned National Championships.</p>
<p>Our program is split up into two teams, A and B. Our A team is a group of individuals who are very dedicated to the team and who put in a large amount of time for practices as well as training outside of practices. Our B team is more oriented towards the development of younger or inexperienced players. B team provides a much more relaxed atmosphere but still remains competitive with all other B teams in the region, and even beats some smaller schools' A teams.</p>
<p>A team has tryouts each year. This year's tryouts will consist of four fall tournaments. There will be a round of cuts made after the second tournament. The tryout roster will then be narrowed down to one team before the final tournament of the fall, via cuts on a rolling basis. Players may be moved between the A and B team rosters as necessary.</p>
