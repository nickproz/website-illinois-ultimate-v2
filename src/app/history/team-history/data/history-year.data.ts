            <p>Illinois Ultimate came into the 2016 season with a taste of success and big shoes to fill. Returning captain Nick Prozorovsky and new captains Prayag Patel and Chris Buchta were tasked with the difficult prospect of replacing the 12 graduating players as well as coach Matt Stupca. Boomland coach Erik Huemiller and recent alum Matt West were able to fill the leadership void as the team looked to reload for another run at Nationals.</p>
            <p>The tryouts for the team were very competitive, with the biggest incoming class in recent memory. The final roster included 7 rookies, 1 grad student, 5 former Boomland players, and 12 returners. The newest iteration of Illinois Ultimate tested themselves at Missouri Loves Company, but returned with shoulder injuries to seniors Nick Prozorovsky and Alex Guy that would hamper them for the rest of the season.</p>
            <p>This spring season had the team heading to Florida, South Carolina, and Missouri in search of elite competition.</p>
            <p>Mid February had the team flying south to compete at Warm Up. Unfortunately, the week prior had grad student Cody Gray breaking his hand in Irwin and senior Wilson Wang pulling his hamstring in the Armory, both big handler losses. On Saturday, the team started with 10-13 and 11-13 losses to Texas and Florida State. The third game of the day was against perennial powerhouse Pittsburgh. Illinois came out sloppy and was pressured into making many errors, resulting in a 1-7 score at half and an embarrassing 2-12 loss, finishing 0-4 on the day after another loss to BYU. Saturday started off better with a 13-5 win over host South Florida, but was followed by big losses to Virginia Tech and Auburn. Illinois finished the tournament 2-7, with a universe loss to in region rival Northwestern and only wins coming against South Florida.</p>
            <p>With most of the team finally healthy, the team made the trip to Easterns for the second tournament of the season. The first game of the tournament was a rematch against Pittsburgh. This time, Illinois was prepared for the intensity and was able to make it a closer game, but still lost 12-15. Another rematch against Virginia Tech ended similarly, losing 11-14, and the team ended Saturday 0-4, with a 10-15 loss to UNC Darkside and an 11-13 loss to regional rival Michigan. On a wet, cold, and windy Sunday, Illinois was not able to come out with any fire and lost badly to James Madison and Connecticut, going 0-6 on the weekend.</p>
            <p>The final regular season tournament of the year was Huck Finn and the boys from Illinois looked to bounce back from a so far unsuccessful regular season. With a mindset of improving for the series the Illini came out with a 7-0 lead at half on Indiana and closed it out with an 11-4 win. Dayton was the next game, which was a 13-4 win for the Illini which meant that they would play Maryland for the pool. Ankle injuries to Prayag Patel and Ben Foster meant that the O line was playing without two key contributors, but the team was able to tough out a 14-11 win, setting up a crossover game against Illinois State. In a very windy game, Illinois triumphed over their in state competitors in a 10-6 victory, securing a quarterfinals berth. The team closed out the tournament with losses to Arkansas and Purdue, and prepared themselves for Conferences.</p>
            <p>Once again, Rantoul was host to Conferences, but this time there could be no complaints about the weather. Illinois started out strong with comfortable wins over the rest of the pool, including an 11-4 victory over UChicago. Winning the pool lined up a semifinal game against Illinois State, which was won handily 13-7 and set up a classic Illinois - Northwestern rematch. Unfortunately, the team struggled to find the endzone and for the second year in a row, lost to Northwestern at Conferences. In the 2nd place match against UChicago, Illinois was unable to find a groove and lost 9-11. With Regionals in two weeks and only one bid for the region, Illinois had a lot of work to do.</p>
            <p>In a change of pace, Regionals was not hosted in Rockford, but in Fair Oaks, Indiana. The conditions were terrible, low temperatures coupled with heavy wind and rain meant that it would be difficult getting a good grip. In the first game against Kentucky, both O and D line were able to perform well, giving up no breaks and handing out a few of their own and finishing with a score of 12-6. The trend continued against Indiana, with Illinois winning 13-6. Next up was Notre Dame, a rematch of last year’s finals, winner takes the pool and quarterfinals berth. A completely upwind/downwind game found the d line with opportunities to break, but never able to finish the job. With neither team being broken, Notre Dame won the flip and the game, 9-10. Illinois finished up the day with a 13-5 win over Michigan State to set up a quarterfinals matchup against Northwestern.</p>
            <p>Conditions on Sunday were better and with a little support from Walden Nelson, the team was ready to avenge their recent losses. Illinois started on D and Northwestern came out with an break early in the game, but the team fought back and breaks were traded to have it be on serve at half. The second half commenced with more of a cleaner game, with both teams trading offensive holds. A chance at a break due to a Nick Pro sky was called back on a controversial observer ruling and the game reached softcap with the score 10-11. Chris Buchta tied up the score with a huck from Kevin Lin and the d line went out to try and break with the season on the line. After a turn from Northwestern, Illinois worked the disc down the field and rookie Jacob Cuthbert took a timeout outside of the endzone. One endzone set later, Prayag found Cuthbert for the win, sending Illinois to the semifinals.</p>
            <p>Due to the loss in pool play, Illinois’s matchup in the semifinals was Michigan. Despite the tough game before, Illinois had to come out hot if they wanted to win the game. Michigan came out of the gate fast, scoring on a huck. Illinois followed suit, and the two teams traded offensive holds until Michigan broke for 3-5. As the game went on, the defensive pressure from Michigan intensified and Illinois’ o line was not able to match the goals that Michigan’s o line was putting out. Coming out of half at 5-8, Illinois turned and was broken again. A late injury to Prayag pushed the hope of a comeback a little further out of reach and a senior d line was unable to keep Michigan from seizing the victory 10-15. Michigan went on to defeat Notre Dame 15-9 to take the bid to Nationals. Illinois finished the season with a 11-10 victory over Purdue for 3rd in the region.</p>
            <p>Captain Nick Prozorovsky and John Saniat received 1st team All-Region honors and Captain Prayag Patel received 2nd team All-Region. Ben Sabourin and Jacob Cuthbert were voted All-Freshmen for the region, with Ben winning Freshman of the Year.</p>
