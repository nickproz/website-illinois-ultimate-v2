<h2>If you are here, you must be curious about playing Ultimate Frisbee at Illinois and our 2020-2021 season plans.</h2>
<p class="recruitment-text">As of now, Illinois Rise intends to practice to the best of our ability during the Fall 2020 semester. Given new rules and regulations for student organizations, we have not been assigned a practice schedule yet. A lot of things are unclear, and because of this and the influx of students at the start of the semester, we will not be having practices for the first two weeks of the semester.</p>
<p class="recruitment-text">The weekend of August 22nd-23rd, the University is hosting a virtual Quad Day from 12pm to 4pm CST (both days). If you are interested in learning more about the program, join our <a href="https://illinois.zoom.us/j/6869060113?pwd=VFgwRFl4S3ZWYkdxSXFNelNGbzgzQT09"> zoom meeting </a> this weekend! We probably won't be able to answer all your questions, but you will get to know our leadership and what we're all about.</p>
<p class="recruitment-text">You should also fill out our <a href="/#/prospects">prospective players form</a>, and a captain will reach out to you. Or, if you have questions, you can <a href="/#/contact">email us</a>.</p>
