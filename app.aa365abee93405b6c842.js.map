Us</h1>\\n<p>Illinois Ultimate is one of the premier ultimate programs in the Midwest and frequently ranks in the National top 25. We strive to contend with the best programs in the country and qualify to compete at Nationals regulary. We are a program that prides itself on developing players who come to Illinois with no experience playing competitive ultimate. We teach all levels of ultimate, from the basics of throwing a forehand all the way to throwing bombs in the worst of weather.</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"ui header\\\">Mission Statement</h2>\\n<p>We want to compete at the highest level possible in college ultimate while remaining respectful to our opponents.  We want to develop all our of players to become the best they can be at ultimate, as well as players who exemplify the true meaning of sportsmanship, which is pivotal to the progress of ultimate frisbee in its current state.</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"ui header\\\">Team Structure/Affiliation with University</h2>\\n<p>Our team is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at the University of Illinois and we are classified as a club sport. We receive some funding from the University that helps pay for our travel costs and hotels while we are at tournaments.</p>\\n<p>We are a member of the USAU  College Series and compete in a series of tournaments that  culminate in the College Championships held every year during Memorial Day weekend. Most, if not all, state schools have established ultimate teams and many smaller schools have teams as well.  We compete in the Illinois conference which is as you can guess, the schools in the state of Illinois. The next largest division is the Great Lakes Region, which includes the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Kentucky. The final step is the aforementioned National Championships.</p>\\n<p>Our program is split up into two teams, A and B. Our A team is a group of individuals who are very dedicated to the team and who put in a large amount of time for practices as well as training outside of practices. Our B team is more oriented towards the development of younger or inexperienced players. B team provides a much more relaxed atmosphere but still remains competitive with all other B teams in the region, and even beats some smaller schools' A teams.</p>\\n<p>A team has tryouts each year, consisting of three to four tournaments in the fall. The first round of cuts will usually be made after the second tournament. The tryout roster will then be narrowed down to one team before the final tournament of the fall, via cuts on a rolling basis. Players may be moved between the A and B team rosters as necessary.</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 41 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t// css-to-string-loader: transforms styles from css-loader to a string output\n\t\n\t// Get the styles\n\tvar styles = __webpack_require__(42);\n\t\n\tif (typeof styles === 'string') {\n\t  // Return an existing string\n\t  module.exports = styles;\n\t} else {\n\t  // Call the custom toString method from css-loader module\n\t  module.exports = styles.toString();\n\t}\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 42 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\texports = module.exports = __webpack_require__(38)();\n\t// imports\n\t\n\t\n\t// module\n\texports.push([module.id, \"p{text-align:left}\", \"\"]);\n\t\n\t// exports\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 43 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar __decorate = (this && this.__decorate) || function (decorators, target, key, desc) {\n\t    var c = arguments.length, r = c < 3 ? target : desc === null ? desc = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, key) : desc, d;\n\t    if (typeof Reflect === \"object\" && typeof Reflect.decorate === \"function\") r = Reflect.decorate(decorators, target, key, desc);\n\t    else for (var i = decorators.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) if (d = decorators[i]) r = (c < 3 ? d(r) : c > 3 ? d(target, key, r) : d(target, key)) || r;\n\t    return c > 3 && r && Object.defineProperty(target, key, r), r;\n\t};\n\tvar __metadata = (this && this.__metadata) || function (k, v) {\n\t    if (typeof Reflect === \"object\" && typeof Reflect.metadata === \"function\") return Reflect.metadata(k, v);\n\t};\n\tvar core_1 = __webpack_require__(7);\n\tvar google_spreadsheet_service_1 = __webpack_require__(44);\n\tvar gtm_util_1 = __webpack_require__(45);\n\tvar ProspectivePlayersComponent = (function () {\n\t    // Constructor with our http service injected\n\t    function ProspectivePlayersComponent(spreadsheetService) {\n\t        this.spreadsheetService = spreadsheetService;\n\t        // API url for our personal server\n\t        this.googleSheetsApiUrl = 'https://nick-proz-node-server.herokuapp.com/sheets/11ijrHoysiIwsFfEggbSNM9Y8VvzU65jeuhQ3vkV5FGw/sheetIndex/1/rows/';\n\t        // API url for our backup server (sheetsu API)\n\t        // private googleSheetsBackupApiUrl = 'https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/7a030ae60b7d';\n\t        this.googleSheetsBackupApiUrl = '';\n\t        // Error messages\n\t        this.validationErrors = 'Please do not leave any required fields blank.';\n\t        this.submissionError = 'Could not submit the form  due to a server error.

Illinois alumni have gone on to play for nationals caliber club teams such as Chicago Machine, Minneapolis Drag 'n Thrust, Cincinnati Steamboat, Atlanta Chain Lightning, and San Francisco Blackbird. Alumni have played on professional AUDL teams such as the Chicago Wildfire, Minnesota Windchill, Cincinnati Revolution, and the San Jose Spiders. They have also created and captained club teams including Chicago Machine, Black Market Ultimate, and Beachfront Ultimate, and have gone on to coach college ultimate at the University of Illinois, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Kentucky. It's safe to say that once you play ultimate at Illinois you are opened up to a world of opportunity through our alumni network, who are more than willing to assist you on your journey though ultimate during and beyond your college years.</p>\\n<p>While you are at Illinois you will enjoy a number of experiences. This ranges from team socials to study groups and from practices in Irwin Fieldhouse to playing games on the shores of San Diego. Your teammates won't only be your best friends, they will be family. You will learn the various ways ultimate is played, how to expand your throwing arsenal, how to improve your athleticism, and how to take your game to the next level. A majority of our team didn't play organized ultimate before coming to college, and are now some of the best players in the Great Lakes region (see our All-Regions honors page).</p>\\n<p>We encourage prospective players to fill out our interest form and to reach out to the captains especially if you will be on campus.

Returning captain Nick Prozorovsky and new captains Prayag Patel and Chris Buchta were tasked with the difficult prospect of replacing the 12 graduating players as well as coach Matt Stupca. Boomland coach Erik Huemiller and recent alum Matt West were able to fill the leadership void as the team looked to reload for another run at Nationals.</p>\\n            <p>The tryouts for the team were very competitive, with the biggest incoming class in recent memory. The final roster included 7 rookies, 1 grad student, 5 former Boomland players, and 12 returners. The newest iteration of Illinois Ultimate tested themselves at Missouri Loves Company, but returned with shoulder injuries to seniors Nick Prozorovsky and Alex Guy that would hamper them for the rest of the season.</p>\\n            <p>This spring season had the team heading to Florida, South Carolina, and Missouri in search of elite competition.</p>\\n            <p>Mid February had the team flying south to compete at Warm Up. Unfortunately, the week prior had grad student Cody Gray breaking his hand in Irwin and senior Wilson Wang pulling his hamstring in the Armory, both big handler losses. On Saturday, the team started with 10-13 and 11-13 losses to Texas and Florida State. The third game of the day was against perennial powerhouse Pittsburgh. Illinois came out sloppy and was pressured into making many errors, resulting in a 1-7 score at half and an embarrassing 2-12 loss, finishing 0-4 on the day after another loss to BYU. Saturday started off better with a 13-5 win over host South Florida, but was followed by big losses to Virginia Tech and Auburn. Illinois finished the tournament 2-7, with a universe loss to in region rival Northwestern and only wins coming against South Florida.</p>\\n            <p>With most of the team finally healthy, the team made the trip to Easterns for the second tournament of the season. The first game of the tournament was a rematch against Pittsburgh. This time, Illinois was prepared for the intensity and was able to make it a closer game, but still lost 12-15. Another rematch against Virginia Tech ended similarly, losing 11-14, and the team ended Saturday 0-4, with a 10-15 loss to UNC Darkside and an 11-13 loss to regional rival Michigan. On a wet, cold, and windy Sunday, Illinois was not able to come out with any fire and lost badly to James Madison and Connecticut, going 0-6 on the weekend.</p>\\n            <p>The final regular season tournament of the year was Huck Finn and the boys from Illinois looked to bounce back from a so far unsuccessful regular season. With a mindset of improving for the series the Illini came out with a 7-0 lead at half on Indiana and closed it out with an 11-4 win. Dayton was the next game, which was a 13-4 win for the Illini which meant that they would play Maryland for the pool. Ankle injuries to Prayag Patel and Ben Foster meant that the O line was playing without two key contributors, but the team was able to tough out a 14-11 win, setting up a crossover game against Illinois State. In a very windy game, Illinois triumphed over their in state competitors in a 10-6 victory, securing a quarterfinals berth. The team closed out the tournament with losses to Arkansas and Purdue, and prepared themselves for Conferences.</p>\\n            <p>Once again, Rantoul was host to Conferences, but this time there could be no complaints about the weather. Illinois started out strong with comfortable wins over the rest of the pool, including an 11-4 victory over UChicago. Winning the pool lined up a semifinal game against Illinois State, which was won handily 13-7 and set up a classic Illinois - Northwestern rematch. Unfortunately, the team struggled to find the endzone and for the second year in a row, lost to Northwestern at Conferences. In the 2nd place match against UChicago, Illinois was unable to find a groove and lost 9-11. With Regionals in two weeks and only one bid for the region, Illinois had a lot of work to do.</p>\\n            <p>In a change of pace, Regionals was not hosted in Rockford, but in Fair Oaks, Indiana. The conditions were terrible, low temperatures coupled with heavy wind and rain meant that it would be difficult getting a good grip. In the first game against Kentucky, both O and D line were able to perform well, giving up no breaks and handing out a few of their own and finishing with a score of 12-6. The trend continued against Indiana, with Illinois winning 13-6. Next up was Notre Dame, a rematch of last year\\u2019s finals, winner takes the pool and quarterfinals berth. A completely upwind/downwind game found the d line with opportunities to break, but never able to finish the job. With neither team being broken, Notre Dame won the flip and the game, 9-10. Illinois finished up the day with a 13-5 win over Michigan State to set up a quarterfinals matchup against Northwestern.</p>\\n            <p>Conditions on Sunday were better and with a little support from Walden Nelson, the team was ready to avenge their recent losses. Illinois started on D and Northwestern came out with an break early in the game, but the team fought back and breaks were traded to have it be on serve at half. The second half commenced with more of a cleaner game, with both teams trading offensive holds. A chance at a break due to a Nick Pro sky was called back on a controversial observer ruling and the game reached softcap with the score 10-11. Chris Buchta tied up the score with a huck from Kevin Lin and the d line went out to try and break with the season on the line. After a turn from Northwestern, Illinois worked the disc down the field and rookie Jacob Cuthbert took a timeout outside of the endzone. One endzone set later, Prayag found Cuthbert for the win, sending Illinois to the semifinals.</p>\\n            <p>Due to the loss in pool play, Illinois\\u2019s matchup in the semifinals was Michigan. Despite the tough game before, Illinois had to come out hot if they wanted to win the game. Michigan came out of the gate fast, scoring on a huck. Illinois followed suit, and the two teams traded offensive holds until Michigan broke for 3-5. As the game went on, the defensive pressure from Michigan intensified and Illinois\\u2019 o line was not able to match the goals that Michigan\\u2019s o line was putting out. Coming out of half at 5-8, Illinois turned and was broken again. A late injury to Prayag pushed the hope of a comeback a little further out of reach and a senior d line was unable to keep Michigan from seizing the victory 10-15. Michigan went on to defeat Notre Dame 15-9 to take the bid to Nationals. Illinois finished the season with a 11-10 victory over Purdue for 3rd in the region.</p>\\n            <p>Captain Nick Prozorovsky and John Saniat received 1st team All-Region honors and Captain Prayag Patel received 2nd team All-Region. Ben Sabourin and Jacob Cuthbert were voted All-Freshmen for the region, with Ben winning Freshman of the Year.</p>\\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2015,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2015.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>After the worst regionals performance since 2006, Illinois entered the 2015 season with a new looking team and a new mindset. Major losses included long time coach Walden Nelson, as well as O-line stars Neal Phelps, Brian Rathunde, and Sean Hill. Marty Markenson returned as captain and was joined by first-timers Johnny Saniat and Nick Prozorovsky.</p>\\n            <p>The major change to the team came in the form of returning coach, Matt Stupca. Matt coached the team from 2006-2009 and brought them to Nationals twice, finishing in 5th place in 2008. The experienced coach gave the team the necessary leadership needed to rebuild the club for a possible Nationals run again.</p>\\n            <p>As always, the fall tryouts were competitive and exciting, with another strong rookie class and many B-teamers and outsiders joining the scene. When it was all said and done, the final roster consisted of 23 people. The roster included 2 rookies, 5 B-teamers, 15 returners, and 1 transfer student. New additions included Valparaiso stud, Matt West, basketball crossover Jarred Elliot, lovable spirit leader Eric Badger, and rookies Kevin Lin and Jacob Komenda.</p>\\n            <p>Come end of fall, Illinois was re-armed and ready for another run for Nationals in the spring season.</p>\\n            <p>The spring season schedule was perhaps one of Illinois' most busy. The team was scheduled to attend 3 of the highest level tournaments around the country, including tournaments in Texas, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>\\n            <p>When February came around, it was time to head south to Tampa for the first spring tournament, Florida Warm-Up. For the first time, the team traveled by air to a tournament. Warm-Up, a three day tournament, proved to be a useful lesson to the team. On day one, the Illini went 1-3 with only one win in a night game vs. Cornell. It was a disappointing performance, but day two spelt different stories for Illinois. Saturday morning, The Illini would play the revered Nationals team UCF in a game that was recorded by Ultiworld. The Illini were no doubt underdogs, but fought hard to take a lead on the Dogs of War. Major plays included a Callahan by handler Prayag Patel and a huck break-score by Max Willis to rookie Jacob Komenda. The Dogs of War fought, but the Illini pulled through, winning the game 13-9 and claiming one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Illinois would cruise to two more wins that day, finishing 3-0 for Saturday. With emotions high but legs tired, the Illini finished off the long weekend with a tough loss against Georgetown and a win against Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Sunday to end Florida Warm up. They finished 5-4 on the weekend.</p>\\n            <p>The next big tournament was the famous Centex invite in Austin, Texas. The team was seeded 9th overall out of 20 after their impressive win against Central Florida back at Warm-Up. With high expectations, the Illini would jump right into it, playing one of the best teams of 2015, North-Carolina Wilmington. The first point of the game would prove to be somewhat of a theme for the Illini that weekend, as top cutter Nick Prozorovsky would go down with a knee injury. The Illini could not upset the big dog this time though, as Wilmington won comfortably at 11-3.</p>\\n            <p>As the day went on, the injuries continued. Nearly half of the Illini squad would go down that day. The pain also showed in the scores, as the Illini would lose to Texas 12-5 and fall to two lower-seeded teams Arkansas and Iowa. They finished 0-4 on Saturday. </p>\\n            <p>In the loser's bracket on Sunday, Illinois would go 3-0 with wins over California, Iowa State, and Wisconsin-Milwaukee. </p>\\n            <p>The finale of the spring tournaments was the very competitive Easterns in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which a year earlier was won by Great Lakes region rival Michigan. The Illini went into the tournament with a bit of a different look, as Boomland coach Erik Huemiller would fill in for coach Matt Stupca as well as numerous injured and absent players returning to the squad. They were seeded as the 20 seed, with nowhere to go but up.</p>\\n            <p>In a highly competitive pool, the Illini would start off against the 2012-2013 national champions, Pittsburgh. Pitt had won every tournament up to this point. The Illini took advantage of Pitts many sloppy mistakes, but could not come away with another upset, falling 15-10. The troubles continued, with losses to Carleton College, UMass, and Georgia. This put the Illini's first day record at a troubling 1-12 on the season.</p>\\n            <p>Sunday would prove to be an important day for the Illini. Despite the troubles on Day 1s, the Illini had played well the second day of tournaments all season, with a 6-0 record. As the last ranked seed at the tournament, they would fight to break seed against NC State, Colorado State, and 10-seeded Auburn.</p>\\n            <p>With many different position changes, the Illini came out with a new fire, going 3-0 again on Sunday and taking out the competition handily. With this, the Illini spring regular season would come to an end. They would finish with a 10-12 record, with only one of those wins coming on day one of a tournament. This issue would be in the back of everyone's head going into the postseason.</p>\\n            <p>Sectionals, as always, was held in Rantoul, IL. The Illini came in as the favorite, with Northwestern and UChicago sitting close behind. The Illini would rough out wins against Eastern Illinois and Southern Illinois before taking on UChicago, who had ended their 2014 season dramatically last year at regionals.</p>\\n            <p>The game was up and down but eventually ended in another crushing loss for the Illini on universe point. This sent the Illini into Sunday with a first round match against other rival Northwestern, who the team hadn't played since last year. The game was close early on, but the upstate rivals pulled ahead and eventually took the game 15-9. It was the second very alarming loss in a row for the Illini, and for the first time in years, would eliminate them from winning sectionals.</p>\\n            <p>Despite this news, the Illini took down Illinois State in the next game to ensure another game against UChicago for second place in the section. In the game that had a game to go atmosphere, the Illini finally were able to hit on all cylinders, blowing out their recent rivals 15-6 and taking second place at sectionals. It would prove to be somewhat of a weight lifted off everyone's back going into regionals, but there was still much work to be done.</p>\\n            <p>Regionals was back at Rockford, a place of many emotions for most Illinois players. Illinois came in as the 3 seed; in a pool with Purdue, Grand Valley, and again, UChicago. The recent ups and downs of the Illinois season, as well as inspiring messages by coach Stupca and some of the players, had the team focused as ever.</p>\\n            <p>The first game against Purdue saw the O-Line in cruise control with a level of consistency not seen before in the season. With a few breaks mixed in, the Illini took the first game of the day 11-8. With an easier 13-6 win against Grand Valley State, Illinois would play their final game of the day against UChicago. The game was played just a few fields away from where Chicago ended Illinois season one year prior. Emotions ran high again, but the Illini finally put UChicago to rest in an 11-5 victory. It was a big statement for Illinois and sent them into Sunday's championship bracket riding high.</p>\\n            <p>Illinois went into Sunday still not having been broken yet, a true testament to their O-line's improved focus. The first game of the day was against last year's second Nationals team from the region, Eastern Michigan. The game was tight throughout with both O-lines trading, but the Illini pulled through to win the game 15-12. The game saw the Illini let up one break, which was the first break allowed all weekend.</p>\\n            <p>This sent the team into semis against their athletic, Big 10 counterparts, Indiana. Indiana, for the most part, was completely unfamiliar to the Illini's play style going into the matchup. With the 'game to go' in the back of everyone's heads, the Illini poured on the points and won 15-5, claiming their biggest victory of the tournament. The D-Line shined this game, giving the O-line a much needed rest heading into the biggest game of the season.</p>\\n            <p>The 'game to go' saw the Illini face up against a team they never would have expected. In surprising fashion, the scrappy and energized Notre Dame would stand as their last test of the season. The other side of the bracket would prove to be one to remember, as Notre Dame had beaten rival Michigan after Michigan had beaten Northwestern on double game point the game before. It was win or go home for the Illini.</p>\\n            <p>The game was a spectacle, with many of the program's alumni and half the region watching. And with expectations set on Nationals, the Illini delivered, winning the game 15-7 and punching their ticket to Milwaukee for Nationals.</p>\\n            <p>The victory was a huge one for the program and it proved to be a huge swing in the eventual Coach of the Year award won by Illinois coach, Matt Stupca. Illinois ended the weekend 6-0, and unbelievably, only allowed 1 break all weekend.</p>\\n            <p>The Illini were headed to Nationals!!!</p>\\n            <p>After failing to reach Nationals the year earlier, Illinois returned and were seeded 19th among the competition. The Illini, having struggled against top competition earlier in the season, were highly focused going into Nationals.</p>\\n            <p>Unusual circumstances at other regionals put the Illini in what was considered one of the best Nationals pools ever, Pool C. Their pool included Maryland, Oregon, Florida State, and UNC. Illinois had not played any of those teams during the regular season.</p>\\n            <p>The first game was against Maryland, whose star player and Callahan nominee, was brothers with one of Illinois' rookies. The game was heated though, with highlights including a wild sky by Tyler 'Dutch' DeNooyer and a handblock of Maryland's star by Prayag Patel.</p>\\n            <p>The game came down to the wire, but saw the Illini as the slim victors 15-13, with former Nationals scoring top-lister Nick Prozorovsky catching the final point to put the Illini 1-0 on the weekend. It was a win for the Illini that spoke volumes to the idea that they truly belonged there.</p>\\n            <p>The next matchup was under the lights on the big field against UNC. Illinois faced another top level player, the eventual Callahan winner, Jon Nethercutt. Nethercutt and his UNC Darkside squad had been one of the highest ranked teams going into the tournament and looked even stronger with the return of the mighty cutter, Ben Snell. </p>\\n            <p>Considered the underdogs by far, Illinois jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead, breaking the seemingly unstoppable UNC O-line. The early start proved to be important as Darkside fought back and took the half by only one point. The game was closer than anyone could have predicted.</p>\\n            <p>But it was not enough to take down the Atlantic Coast champs, as Darkside took the game 15-12. Nethercutt proved to be hyped correctly, but the Illini still played strong regardless.</p>\\n            <p>Day 2 saw the Illini in a huge spotlight, facing Oregon Ego to start the day. The road to Nationals had been shaky for Ego, as their struggles at regionals were the sole reason they had even been placed into Pool C as the shocking 15 seed. They sat 0-2 on the weekend, and were in a do-or-die situation for their season. Fittingly, the Illini matched up against them with a chance to end their season, and a chance to end the college career of one of the games' most well-known players, Dylan Freechild.</p>\\n            <p>Freechild and the amped up Ego squad came out strong, taking an early and commanding lead. There were some glimmers of hope for Illinois, but none proved strong enough to get them close, as Ego won the game handily 15-7. This put the Illini at 1-2, and kept the season alive for Oregon.</p>\\n            <p>The final game of pool play came against Chris Laroque and Florida State. A year earlier, Illinois had lost a tough game on double game point against FSU at Easterns. Illinois yet again was a heavy underdog. They managed to keep it close for most the game, but FSU's star-studded team proved too strong as FSU took the game 15-11. It was another game very close at half for Illinois, which was promising. The loss would put Illinois out of contention to move into the next round of play.</p>\\n            <p>In the final game of the season, Illinois would play Cincinnati. With a win, they would claim a tie for 13th place. With a loss, they would finish 17th at Nationals for the 5th time in a row, perhaps proving the 'curse of Illinois-th place' to be true.</p>\\n            <p>But the Illini had no plans to settle for that, as they took the game 15-12 with a bit of a late surge. The game proved to be an Illini classic, with a goal line D by Mark Peterson and a bookends point from Kanzy. The win was topped off with Nick Prozorovsky catching the game winning catch, sending the fans home happy and ending an excellent Illinois season.</p>\\n            <p>Illinois broke the 'curse' and finished 13th, their best Nationals performance since 2008.</p>\\n            <p>Not surprisingly, three of the final four teams were from Pool C, and the championship saw UNC match up against Oregon. UNC would win again, blowing out Oregon 15-6. In the end, it was actually Illinois who had put the most points up on the eventual champions, with 12 points. Nick Prozorovsky finished pool play tied for the lead in goals scored at 24. Most importantly, Illinois broke seed, gaining the respect deserved and achieving their goals. The 13 seniors leaving were sent home happy.</p>\\n            <p>Matt West and Nick Prozorovsky won 1st team all region honors. Kevin Lin won Freshman of the Region. The Matt Stupca deservedly won Coach of the year.</p>\\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2014,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2014.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>Illinois entered the season hoping to return to Nationals.

But won 13th place with wins against Massachusetts and Luther.</p>\\n            <p>Illinois was able to comfortable win the Illinois Conference Championships with a win in the finals over Northwestern. The Great Lakes earned two bids to nationals thanks to Northwestern and Michigan. Illinois won their pool and set themselves up for a shot at Nationals. Northwestern learned from their Conference loss and was able to adapt to slow down the Illinois offense forcing Illinois to fight through the backdoor. They next played Chicago in a windy game in which both teams attempted to score with 50/50 shots. These conditions stopped Illinois' high speed offense and gave Chicago a chance to have many opportunities on defense. Chicago finally finished the game with a stall 9 jump ball in the endzone finishing Illinois' season.</p>\\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2013,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2013.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>After the disappointing and heartbreaking finish in 2012, Illinois lost a huge chunk of veteran talent and had to reload for 2013. Ryan Smith was captain for the 3rd year in a row and was joined by three first year captains in Neal Phelps, Colin Reid and Nathan Gibbons. The captains and the seniors on the team used the previous year's finish as motivation and set the tone at practices throughout the whole year.</p>    \\n            <p>Tryouts were completed shockingly early for the 2nd year in a row. With so many open spots, Illinois was fortunate to receive a very deep and talented freshman class. Five freshman made the A-team, with three of them all coming from the same high school. A large chunk of the team were stepping into new roles or were new to college ultimate altogether. They would be forced to acclimate and adjust quickly if Illinois were to meet it's goals for the year.</p>    \\n            <p>At Huck Finn, Illinois came in very over confident and were punished by the frisbee gods for their hubris. They thought they could walk into the tournament and do well. They got a huge wake up call on Saturday with three losses including a potential candidate for worst loss of the program. Another blemish on Coach Walden Nelson's coaching record. Illinois used their performance on Saturday of Huck Finn as cause for penance and toughed out an undefeated Sunday through atrocious weather conditions.</p>    \\n            <p>The next weekend at Centex, Illinois came out with a renewed focus and sense of urgency. They gritted out a semifinals finish including splitting two universe point games against Harvard. This tournament gave people on the team reason to believe and showed what the team was capable of.</p>    \\n            <p>Sectionals was held in Chicago. There were some tough games, but Illinois won their third consecutive conference championship. After winning the tournament, Illinois did hill sprints to help get mentally prepared for the bloodbath of a 1 bid region.</p>    \\n            <p>Illinois came into Regionals as the #2 seed and knew what they had to do. Just like 2011, the format was pool play on Saturday with bracket play on Sunday. The first two games were comfortable victories. The third pool play game against Indiana was a back and forth affair. Indiana led late in the game, but on long turn-filled universe point, Illinois ground out a tough win.</p>    \\n            <p>Sunday morning, Illinois came out very hot and played extremely well in a good win over up and coming Northwestern. In the first half of the Regional semi-final against MSU, Illinois could not continue their good play. The Oline struggled mightily with execution errors from the younger players on the line. The first half score was 5-8 MSU. Early in the second half, this worrying trend continued and the score went to 6-10 MSU. When things were looking dire, the soon to be graduating players refused to go down without a fight. Big plays from Preston Goulson and Tyler Anderson fueled a furious Illinois comeback highlighted by a big sky from Brian Rathunde. Illinois pulled out a stunning 14-11 win over MSU. This set up the classic Great Lake Regionals matchup between Illinois and Michigan. For the first time since 2008, this matchup would be for the Regional title and the sole bid to Nationals. Illinois maintained a very slim lead throughout the game. The Oline played very calmly even with increased pressure from Michigan. Late in the game, Illinois pulled out a couple breaks and ended the game on a d and subsequent score by Jon McKoy. Illinois returned to Nationals as the sole representative of the Great Lakes. Ryan Smith won Player of the Region honors, Neal Phelps, Nathan Gibbons earned First Team All-Region awards, Brad Bolliger earned a Second Team and Nick Prozorovsky, Johnny Saniat and Derek Yan earned Freshman team awards.</p>    \\n            <p>Unfortunately at Nationals, Illinois could not break the 17th place curse. Some key players were unable to play. Illinois gamely tried to fight on but just could not overcome their depleted personnel.

Major personnel losses included 2-time captain Austin Lien and 3-year O-line starter Chris Hidaka. Zach Frantz and Ryan Smith returned as captains and were joined by Kevin Bruns. With such a large number of returning A-teamers, tryouts were as competitive as ever and there were many people fighting for the few remaining spots. After following the Illinois tradition of making final cuts really late, 3 freshmen had made the A-team, which hadn't happened since 2009.</p>    \\n            <p>For such a veteran team, focus and urgency was lacking during the season. There were many times where people would be going through the motions and not getting the most of the practice. Unlike past years, when the senior class would set the tone for all their younger teammates, this year saw a rift open up between the seniors and the younger members of the team. This rift manifested itself in many ways throughout the season, but it came to a head at Centex where a team meeting was held Saturday night after pool play and two juniors spoke to all the seniors and told them to get their act together.</p>    \\n            <p>With high expectations going into the season, Illinois scheduled a more competitive tournament schedule than in 2011 and went to Easterns and Centex two tournaments with several Nationals contenders in addition to the early season tournament Free State Classic. With all the drama going on behind closed doors, Illinois had an up and down tournament performance with some uncharacteristic big losses. At Free State, Illinois struggled to play in the wind against Iowa and lost to them twice, once on Saturday and again in the Final. At Centex, Illinois played Iowa again and came out hot and took a 3-0 lead, but that quickly disappeared and Iowa won again in dominating fashion. This bled into the most dispiriting performance by Illinois in many years, as they proceeded to be blanked in the first half by Tufts. After play ended, the aforementioned team meeting was held. Sunday of Centex, Illinois came out reinvigorated and played a close game with Luther but eventually lost on universe. The following weekend at Easterns, Illinois played much more consistently and lost twice, once to eventual champions Pittsburgh and again on universe to Tufts. Buoyed by their Easterns results, Illinois looked ahead to the series and a return to Nationals.</p>    \\n            <p>The third annual alumni game was held, and the alumni extended their winning streak to two games after a dismal performance by the college kids. After taking half 8-5, the college team seemed to think the game was over and did not try as hard as the older, more out of shape alumni. Unfortunately, the lessons from the alumni game would not be remembered later in the season.</p>    \\n            <p>Sectionals once again were held in Rantoul and like every other tournament that has ever been held there, the weather was terrible. Saturday was cold, windy, and wet and Illinois took care of business winning every game handily. Sunday was sunny and very windy and after going up by a lot on Northwestern, Illinois lost their focus and let them back into the game. Illinois eventually closed it out and won by a few points.</p>    \\n            <p>Like the past three years, Illinois was counting on being able to flip the switch and play their best ultimate of the season at Regionals. With two bids to Nationals, the best format and Regionals being held in Naperville, confidence was very high that Illinois would be able to get the job done and qualify for Nationals. It was a cold, windy, wet day on Saturday but Illinois won their first game comfortably. In a shocking turn of events, a lack of focus caused Illinois to come out flat against Eastern Illinois in the regional quarterfinals. Eastern Illinois came out and punched in four breaks in a row. Illinois fought back and tied the score at 5-5, but they could never get over the hump and take the lead. Eastern Illinois' Michael Schwenk carried the team to an upset with a 13-10 victory and gave Illinois their first loss at Regionals since 2008.</p>    \\n            <p>With their backs against the wall, Illinois regrouped and took care of business on Saturday and stayed alive in the 2nd place bracket for Sunday. For the first time since 2007, Illinois was not in the Regional Final Sunday morning but instead in a fight for their season in the backdoor semi- finals. They dispatched Indiana 15-7 and had a rematch with Eastern Illinois in the backdoor final. Illinois did not take them lightly this time and came out with a rarely seen intensity and beat Eastern 15-2. However, the team's focus and execution was not there and multiple turnovers on every point culminated in the destruction of Coach Walden Nelson's clipboard. Illinois, after an arduous road, had finally made it to a game to go to Nationals against Michigan State. Illinois started the game out strong and fired up and came out with two quick breaks. MSU played a lot of zone in an effort to negate Ryan Smith's hucks. But Ryan did not take the bait and lead the offense to a clean no break first half and the defense got 3 breaks for an 8-5 halftime lead. Illinois smelled a Nationals berth and came out of half with 2 more points for a commanding 10-5 lead. This was when Michigan State held their ground and began a tenacious comeback. Staying with their zone, MSU began to force more and more turnovers from Illinois and began to convert them for breaks. A 10-5 lead quickly became 10-8 and MSU clawed slowly back from there to finally take the lead at 13-12. A lot of credit is to be given to MSU for never giving up and fighting their way back to the lead. But Illinois' lack of composure on offense coupled with a willingness to turn the disc over, as well as timeout mismanagement by Coach Walden Nelson did not help the cause. Even with all that being said, Illinois scored on offense to make it 13- 13 universe point with the winner going to Nationals. Illinois got the disc twice on universe and both times threw passes into the endzone that hit a receiver's hands, but alas both passes were dropped. After the second drop in the endzone MSU picked up the disc and immediately threw an 80 yard, more than full field huck for the game and the Nationals berth.</p>    \\n            <p>This was not the ending to the 2012 season that Illinois imagined. For the first time since 2007, Illinois' graduating seniors did not get to end their careers at Nationals. With a huge graduating class, it will be up to the few returning A-teamers to pick up the pieces and return Illinois to Nationals.</p>    \\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2011,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2011.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>The program lost several program mainstays such as 5-year A-teamer and 2-time captain Brian Phelan, Top 10 Callahan finisher and captain Walden Nelson, and Team Spirit Leader Kurt Zoellick among others. This required the large junior class to step up and meet the challenge. Juniors Zachary Frantz and Ryan Smith stepped up to become captains alongside returning captain Austin Lien. The captains surveyed the tryout pool and saw that it was one of the most competitive in recent history. Wanting to give everyone a fair look, final cuts weren't made until the end of January. After the smoke cleared, the final roster stood at 27 and after a 1 year hiatus of no freshman making the cut, 2 freshman found themselves on the team.</p>\\n            <p>Even with a full roster, Illinois battled the injury bug throughout the season. Dline handler Adam Wright tore his acl at Rivalry Reheat and only returned for a few points at Nationals. Captain Zachary Frantz battled Plantar Fasciitis the whole year, missing every tournament besides Regionals and Nationals. 5th year cutter Chris Hidaka badly sprained his ankle in the 2nd game of the first tournament and never quite regained his old form. Seniors Suleyman Ahmad and Jonathan Hatcher had leg problems of their own and were in and out of the line up. Junior Ryan Kurnik broke his hand and missed the last half of the season. In addition there were numerous other injuries that kept people away from the field.</p>\\n            <p>However there were still tournaments to be played and games to be won. Compared to past years, Illinois traveled to less competitive tournaments. Unfortunately this did not lead to more victories as Illinois struggled to maintain focus for whole games, often playing one good and one bad half. There were some benefits as several players were able to gain much needed experience playing new and more challenging roles than they were accustomed to. Illinois made semifinals of both the Freestate Classic and Huck Finn before losing to Central Region teams Iowa and Minnesota. Going into the series, Illinois hoped to follow the trends of the past two Illinois teams and play their best ultimate during the series.</p>\\n            <p>Sectionals was held close by in Rantoul, Illinois as people still didn't get the memo not to have tournaments there in the Spring. Saturday was a windy and rainy day, Illinois took care of business and won every game by a comfortable margin. On Sunday, buoyed by the rare beautiful Rantoul weather, Illinois beat Northwestern and Eastern Illinois to repeat as Sectional Champions.</p>\\n            <p>Just like 2010, Illinois had the 3rd seed going into Regionals. Unlike past years only 1 team would make it to Nationals, meaning 1 bad half and the season would be over. Another change was the format, with the format being pool play instead of a straight bracket. In a very windy Saturday, Illinois gutted out a close game against Loyola, winning on double game point. After that scare woke them up, they beat Western Michigan and Notre Dame handily. Everyone on the team was looking forward to facing Michigan in semis but first they would have to get through Indiana in the first game of the day on Sunday. Led by their senior leaders Ed Wu and Taylor Kraemer, Indiana gave Illinois all they could handle in a close back and forth game before Illinois pulled it out winning 15-13. This led to the semifinal showdown with Michigan for the third year in a row. However, this year would be different from the past two years as Illinois came out firing with an intensity that Michigan either could not or was unwilling to match. It was a total team effort as everyone contributed to a resounding 15-9 win. It was a great win, but people were too satisfied with that victory considering that the bid to Nationals was still up for grabs. Illinois still had to face a determined opponent in Michigan State who undoubtedly had plans for revenge from 2010. Fortunately for Illinois, Michigan State had several unforced errors in the first half of the game and Illinois took advantage going up several breaks in the first half. Michigan State tried to mount a comeback in the second half but the score difference was too great. Illinois won the region for the 3rd year in a row and took the regions only bid to Nationals with a 15-11 victory. Illinois had several players who played well during Regionals including but not limited to Dane Jorgensen, Brian Pierce, Austin Lien, Zachary Frantz, Ryan Smith and Neal Phelps. In a surprising turn of events, only Ryan Smith was a member of the All-Region team.</p>\\n            <p>Going into Nationals, Illinois planned on breaking the curse of two straight 17th places. Ironically enough and deservedly so, Illinois had the 17th seed going in. Illinois was in a pool with overall #1 seed Pittsburgh and #12 seed and fan favorite Colorado College. In the first game of Nationals against Colorado College, Illinois battled nerves and had several unforced errors in the first half. However, led by Neal Phelps' stellar defense on Callahan candidate Nicky Spiva and Dane Jorgensen's aerial ability, Illinois fought and clawed back for a gritty 13-11 victory. This was Illinois' first Nationals pool play victory in 2 years and had them primed to take a spot in prequarters. After losing 15-10 to Pittsburgh highlighted by a break with several Nationals first timers and both rookies, Illinois only needed to win 1 of their next 2 games to take a spot in prequarters. Unfortunately, the issues that beguiled Illinois throughout the season came up once again. To put it simply, Illinois did not show up on Saturday of Nationals. Illinois looked lifeless and lost to Iowa 15-10. Even with that being said, Illinois simply had to win against Tufts to advance to the bracket. With their season on the line, Illinois gave a sad, disappointing effort both on the field and on the sidelines. Their effort was no where close to good enough and they got punished deservedly, 15-7, knocking them into the placement bracket for the 3rd year in a row. Illinois lost to Whitman 16-14 after leading most of the game and then in the game they have never lost, beat Florida and took 17th place for the 3rd year in a row. However there is hope for the future with 20 returning players and a talented incoming class, Illinois will look to break the curse of 17th.</p>\\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2010,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2010.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>Illinois had to deal with several big losses from the year before but none bigger than the departure of longtime coach Matt Stupca who coached from 2004-2009.

Dealing with the heavy losses from the year before, Illinois called up a number of players from the B-team and two from the C-team which was a program first. Illinois spent much of the season acclimating the new players so that they would be ready for Nationals level competition.</p>\\n            <p>They had uneven results and growing pains throughout the year, with a highlight being making the finals of Mardis Gras before losing to Wisconsin by a substantial margin.

Illinois beat both Dayton and Purdue handily and advanced to semifinals before finding out that Regionals would be postponed for a week. Having a week to prepare and to heal, Illinois faced Michigan at Regionals as is the norm. In a heavy wind game, which saw several lead changes, but few breaks, and lots of great plays from both teams, Illinois was able to score on a gut-wrenching universe point and won the game 9-8.</p>\\n            <p>This sent Illinois to its 3rd straight Regional final with a chance to repeat as Regional champions for the first time in the programs history. Illinois faced Michigan State with the Regional title on the line and prevailed in a close game with Illinois being able to pull away in the end, 15-10. Illinois repeated as Regional champions for the first time and had Brian Phelan and Walden Nelson win first team All-Region honors and had Ryan Smith win 2nd team All-Region, becoming the first sophomore in the programs history to win a regional award. Illinois was seeded 14th going into Nationals. They lost to Harvard handily but was still in contention for a prequarters berth if they were able to beat both UNCW and Iowa. However, in games possibly showing a lack of experience or the burden of captaining and coaching proving too great, Illinois lost late leads in both games and lost to UNCW 14-12 and to Iowa 16-14. Illinois then played Carleton in a much closer than expected 15-12 loss and lost to Wisconsin. Beating Kansas in the last game of the tournament gave Illinois its only win at Nationals and sent them home with another 17th place finish. Illinois did not graduate as many players as in years past, which makes Illinois in a prime position to continue its Nationals qualifying streak.</p>\\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2009,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2009.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>2009 saw the departures of many fixtures of the Illinois program such as Joel Koehneman, Pat Stephens, Jake Segil and David Abram.

They were filled by Denis Agniel, Brian Phelan and Charlie O'Brien. Like in 2006 when the team lost several impact players, the team was able to recruit a very deep class that rivals and may surpass the freshman class of 2006. This influx of freshman led to the 2nd year of the C- teams existence in the programs history.</p>    \\n            <p>The regular season for Illinois was very rough, with the team trying to find people who would be able to fill the big holes left by the departed players. This led to several big losses throughout the year and poor tournament finishes, culminating in a 13-2 beatdown by regional rival Michigan at Huck Finn. Going into the postseason/the college series, Illinois had a lot of uncertainty. At Sectionals, Illinois took care of business on Saturday and beat a tough North Park team in semifinals and made Finals against Notre Dame. In a rainy, cold final, Illinois looked like they did throughout the season and lost 15-10. This gave Illinois a 4 seed going into Regionals and a definite longshot for one of the two Nationals bids.</p>\\n            <p>Illinois faced tougher than expected games against Kenyon and North Park before meeting Michigan in Regional semifinals. Illinois came together in a way that had not been seen all season, and put forth their best effort of the season and beat Michigan in a tense hard fought game 12-9. This put Illinois in its second straight Regional final against Ohio State. The previous day's momentum carried over as Illinois beat Ohio State handily 15-11, taking home its first Regional championship since 2002.</p>\\n            <p>Illinois placed Denis Agniel, Brian Phelan, Pavan Sarguru, and Walden Nelson on the Great Lakes 2nd Team All-Region, Coach Matt Stupca won the inaugural Coach of the Region award, and Ryan Smith won Freshman of the year. Winning the Region gave Illinois an 8 seed going into Nationals, however whatever magic Illinois had at Regionals was lost at Nationals, as Illinois lost several games by big margins except for one close pool play game against Tufts and the only win against Cal. They did so in good spirit, winning the 2009 Nationals Spirit Award and dubbed Zubair: The most spirited man in ultimate. Although, this performance gave Illinois a disappointing 17th place finish at Nationals and with several players graduating including captain Denis Agniel, the prospect of another rebuilding year loomed large.</p>\\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2008,\n\t        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2008.jpg',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>Using the loss at Regionals the previous year as motivation and determined to make Nationals in captains Joel Koehneman, Pat Stephans and David Abrams, final year.

The biggest margin of victory in Illinois' losses heading into Regionals was 3 points. Illinois suffered some key injuries before Sectionals but managed to persevere and hold of North Park in an exciting 17-16 Sectional Final. Like the previous year Illinois had a 2 seed going into Regionals. They took care of business on Saturday winning all 3 games and securing a spot in the Regional finals. In many people's first Regional final, Illinois played tentatively and lost 15-11 to Michigan putting them in the 2nd place game against Ohio State.

Nationals that year was in Boulder, Colorado and Illinois went into it holding an 8 seed and in a pool with Florida, North Texas and Delaware. Illinois beat Delaware to clinch a spot in prequarters, and lost to Florida and North Texas. In prequarters Illinois was matched up against Michigan, who they had lost to at Regionals and had not beaten since 2004. In a hard fought game led by the graduating players, Illinois prevailed 15-11 sending them into quarters against the hometown team Colorado. In an exciting game that saw several big plays, Illinois lost 15-12 to Colorado and ended their season having them tied for 5th which is the highest finish in the programs history. 2008 saw the departure of many mainstays for Illinois and the following years would show how well the recruiting efforts of 2005 paid off.</p>      \\n        \"\n\t    },\n\t    {\n\t        year: 2007,\n\t        imagePath: '',\n\t        summaryMarkup: \"\\n            <p>Coming off of one the worst years in recent history, Illinois started to put the pieces in place to make a run at a Nationals berth.

This benefited the team, as they were able to match up and see where they stood in relation to both Nationals finalists. As a result, the team was able to see that they were more than prepared to take a Nationals berth out of Regionals.</p>    \\n            <p>Illinois steamrolled through Sectionals and reclaimed the Sectionals crown and had a 2-seed going into Regionals.

In a very heavy upwind downwind game that saw very few breaks, Illinois received going downwind on universe point but was unable to punch it in and lost on a couple floaty upwind hucks. Out of the running for first, Illinois was now in the backdoor bracket having to win every game in order to advance to Nationals. They beat Northwestern and faced Ohio State, the #1 seed going into the tournament who had also lost in semis to Michigan. Perhaps showing a little bit of inexperience in a pressure filled game, Illinois went down big early, going down 5-0, however, they mounted a furious comeback and came close to negating the early deficit, but eventually succumbed 15-12 and ending their season without a Nationals berth for the 3rd year in a row.

This led to one of the deepest freshman classes in the programs history largely due to the efforts of Brian Korbesmeyer. In order to facilitate the rebuilding process, the leadership decided to go with a very small A-team roster of less than 20 guys, so that everyone would be able to play both on the A-team and on the B-team. The B-team with the services of coach Nick McDuffee was able to nurture the players and have them ready to take the next step onto the A-team. It was a season with very few bright spots, as Illinois did not make the Sectional final for one of the few times in modern history, finishing 4th at Sectionals, and did not even make Sunday of Regionals, finishing tied for 7th after losing in quarterfinals and getting eliminated in the backdoor bracket.

If used\n     * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n     * control.\n     *\n     * @howToUse\n     *\n     * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n     * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n     *\n     * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n     * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n     * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n     * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n     * the domain model in your class as well.\n     *\n     * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n     * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n     * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n     * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n     * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n     * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n     *\n     * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n     *\n     * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n     * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n     *\n     * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n     * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n     * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n     * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n     *\n     * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n     * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n     * than the domain model's value on submit.\n     *\n     * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n     *\n     * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n     *\n     * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n     * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n     *\n     * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n     *\n     *  @stable\n     */\n    var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$7(NgModel, _super);\n        function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            /** @internal */\n            this._control = new FormControl();\n            /** @internal */\n            this._registered = false;\n            this.update = new EventEmitter();\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n            this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n            this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n        }\n        NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            this._checkForErrors();\n            if (!this._registered)\n                this._setUpControl();\n            if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                this._updateDisabled(changes);\n            }\n            if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                this._updateValue(this.model);\n                this.viewModel = this.model;\n            }\n        };\n        NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n        Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n            get: function () { return this._control; },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?

Midwest and frequently ranks in the National top 25. We strive to contend with the best programs in the country and qualify to compete at Nationals regulary. We are a program that prides itself on developing players who come to Illinois with no experience playing competitive ultimate. We teach all levels of ultimate, from the basics of throwing a forehand all the way to throwing bombs in the worst of weather.</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"ui header\\\">Mission Statement</h2>\\n<p>We want to compete at the highest level possible in college ultimate while remaining respectful to our opponents.  We want to develop all our of players to become the best they can be at ultimate, as well as players who exemplify the true meaning of sportsmanship, which is pivotal to the progress of ultimate frisbee in its current state.</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"ui header\\\">Team Structure/Affiliation with University</h2>\\n<p>Our team is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at the University of Illinois and we are classified as a club sport. We receive some funding from the University that helps pay for our travel costs and hotels while we are at tournaments.</p>\\n<p>We are a member of the USAU  College Series and compete in a series of tournaments that  culminate in the College Championships held every year during Memorial Day weekend. Most, if not all, state schools have established ultimate teams and many smaller schools have teams as well.  We compete in the Illinois conference which is as you can guess, the schools in the state of Illinois. The next largest division is the Great Lakes Region, which includes the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Kentucky. The final step is the aforementioned National Championships.</p>\\n<p>Our program is split up into two teams, A and B. Our A team is a group of individuals who are very dedicated to the team and who put in a large amount of time for practices as well as training outside of practices. Our B team is more oriented towards the development of younger or inexperienced players. B team provides a much more relaxed atmosphere but still remains competitive with all other B teams in the region, and even beats some smaller schools' A teams.</p>\\n<p>A team has tryouts each year, consisting of three to four tournaments in the fall. The first round of cuts will usually be made after the second tournament. The tryout roster will then be narrowed down to one team before the final tournament of the fall, via cuts on a rolling basis. Players may be moved between the A and B team rosters as necessary.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/about/about.component.html\n// module id = 40\n// module chunks = 0","// css-to-string-loader: transforms styles from css-loader to a string output\n\n// Get the styles\nvar styles = require(\"!!../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/less-loader/index.js!./about.component.less\");\n\nif (typeof styles === 'string') {\n  // Return an existing string\n  module.exports = styles;\n} else {\n  // Call the custom toString method from css-loader module\n  module.exports = styles.toString();\n}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/about/about.component.less\n// module id = 41\n// module chunks = 0","exports = module.exports = require(\"../../../node_modules/css-loader/lib/css-base.js\")();\n// imports\n\n\n// module\nexports.push([module.id, \"p{text-align:left}\", \"\"]);\n\n// exports\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/css-loader!./~/postcss-loader/lib!./~/less-loader!./src/app/about/about.component.less\n// module id = 42\n// module chunks = 0","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { SpreadsheetService } from '../global/service/google-spreadsheet.service';\nimport { GtmUtil } from '../global/util/gtm.util';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'prospective-players',\n    template: require('./prospective-players.component.html'),\n    styles: [require('./prospective-players.component.less')]\n})\nexport class ProspectivePlayersComponent implements OnInit {\n    // API url for our personal server\n    private googleSheetsApiUrl = 'https://nick-proz-node-server.herokuapp.com/sheets/11ijrHoysiIwsFfEggbSNM9Y8VvzU65jeuhQ3vkV5FGw/sheetIndex/1/rows/';\n    // API url for our backup server (sheetsu API)\n    // private googleSheetsBackupApiUrl = 'https://sheetsu.com/apis/v1.0/7a030ae60b7d';\n    private googleSheetsBackupApiUrl = '';\n\n    // Error messages\n    private validationErrors: string = 'Please do not leave any required fields blank.';\n    private submissionError: string = 'Could not submit the form  due to a server error.

Illinois has qualified for national championships frequently behind our dedication, determination, and distinguished character on and off the field. Illinois alumni have gone on to play for nationals caliber club teams such as Chicago Machine, Minneapolis Drag 'n Thrust, Cincinnati Steamboat, Atlanta Chain Lightning, and San Francisco Blackbird. Alumni have played on professional AUDL teams such as the Chicago Wildfire, Minnesota Windchill, Cincinnati Revolution, and the San Jose Spiders. They have also created and captained club teams including Chicago Machine, Black Market Ultimate, and Beachfront Ultimate, and have gone on to coach college ultimate at the University of Illinois, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Kentucky. It's safe to say that once you play ultimate at Illinois you are opened up to a world of opportunity through our alumni network, who are more than willing to assist you on your journey though ultimate during and beyond your college years.</p>\\n<p>While you are at Illinois you will enjoy a number of experiences. This ranges from team socials to study groups and from practices in Irwin Fieldhouse to playing games on the shores of San Diego. Your teammates won't only be your best friends, they will be family. You will learn the various ways ultimate is played, how to expand your throwing arsenal, how to improve your athleticism, and how to take your game to the next level. A majority of our team didn't play organized ultimate before coming to college, and are now some of the best players in the Great Lakes region (see our All-Regions honors page).</p>\\n<p>We encourage prospective players to fill out our interest form and to reach out to the captains especially if you will be on campus. We are more than happy to meet up and discuss what Illinois can do for you, and to see what you can do to be ready for Illinois once you get on campus. Our contact information is below. Thank you for taking the time to visit our website, and we hope to hear from you soon.</p>\\n<!--Form-->\\n<form class=\\\"ui form\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"two fields\\\">\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <label>First Name <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n                <input [(ngModel)]=\\\"firstName\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"first-name\\\" placeholder=\\\"First Name\\\">\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <label>Last Name <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n                <input [(ngModel)]=\\\"lastName\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"last-name\\\" placeholder=\\\"Last Name\\\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"two fields\\\">\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <label>Email Address <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n                <input [(ngModel)]=\\\"emailAddress\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"email-address\\\" placeholder=\\\"Email Address\\\">\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <label>What is your Hometown? <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n                <input [(ngModel)]=\\\"hometown\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"home-town\\\" placeholder=\\\"Hometown\\\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"two fields\\\">\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <label>What high school did you attend? <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n                <input [(ngModel)]=\\\"highschool\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"highschool\\\" placeholder=\\\"High School\\\">\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <label>What major are you planning on going into? <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n                <input [(ngModel)]=\\\"major\\\" type=\\\"text\\\" name=\\\"major\\\" placeholder=\\\"Major\\\">\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n            <label>How long have you played ultimate/what kind of experience do you have? <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n            <textarea [(ngModel)]=\\\"experience\\\" name=\\\"experience\\\" rows=\\\"2\\\"></textarea>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n            <label>What other clubs/organizations are you planning on joining when you arrive on campus? <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n            <textarea [(ngModel)]=\\\"otherClubs\\\" name=\\\"other-clubs\\\" rows=\\\"2\\\"></textarea>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"inline fields\\\">\\n            <label>Would you be alright with a captain or coach reaching out to you? <span class=\\\"required\\\">*</span></label>\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <div class=\\\"ui radio checkbox\\\">\\n                    <input id=\\\"contact-yes\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"contact\\\" type=\\\"radio\\\" name=\\\"contact\\\" value=\\\"Yes\\\" checked=\\\"checked\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\" class=\\\"hidden\\\">\\n                    <label for=\\\"contact-yes\\\">Yes</label>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\\\"field\\\">\\n                <div class=\\\"ui radio checkbox\\\">\\n                    <input id=\\\"contact-no\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"contact\\\" type=\\\"radio\\\" name=\\\"contact\\\" value=\\\"No\\\" tabindex=\\\"0\\\" class=\\\"hidden\\\">\\n                    <label for=\\\"contact-no\\\">No</label>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    <button (click)=\\\"handleSubmit($event)\\\" class=\\\"ui button submit-button\\\" type=\\\"submit\\\">Submit</button>\\n    <!--Error/Success Messages-->\\n    <div class=\\\"ui error message\\\" *ngIf=\\\"formErrors\\\">\\n        <p>{{formErrors}}</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"ui success message\\\" *ngIf=\\\"submitSuccess\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"header\\\">Form Submitted</div>\\n        <p>The form was successfully submitted!

Returning captain Nick Prozorovsky and new captains Prayag Patel and Chris Buchta were tasked with the difficult prospect of replacing the 12 graduating players as well as coach Matt Stupca. Boomland coach Erik Huemiller and recent alum Matt West were able to fill the leadership void as the team looked to reload for another run at Nationals.</p>\n            <p>The tryouts for the team were very competitive, with the biggest incoming class in recent memory. The final roster included 7 rookies, 1 grad student, 5 former Boomland players, and 12 returners. The newest iteration of Illinois Ultimate tested themselves at Missouri Loves Company, but returned with shoulder injuries to seniors Nick Prozorovsky and Alex Guy that would hamper them for the rest of the season.</p>\n            <p>This spring season had the team heading to Florida, South Carolina, and Missouri in search of elite competition.</p>\n            <p>Mid February had the team flying south to compete at Warm Up. Unfortunately, the week prior had grad student Cody Gray breaking his hand in Irwin and senior Wilson Wang pulling his hamstring in the Armory, both big handler losses. On Saturday, the team started with 10-13 and 11-13 losses to Texas and Florida State. The third game of the day was against perennial powerhouse Pittsburgh. Illinois came out sloppy and was pressured into making many errors, resulting in a 1-7 score at half and an embarrassing 2-12 loss, finishing 0-4 on the day after another loss to BYU. Saturday started off better with a 13-5 win over host South Florida, but was followed by big losses to Virginia Tech and Auburn. Illinois finished the tournament 2-7, with a universe loss to in region rival Northwestern and only wins coming against South Florida.</p>\n            <p>With most of the team finally healthy, the team made the trip to Easterns for the second tournament of the season. The first game of the tournament was a rematch against Pittsburgh. This time, Illinois was prepared for the intensity and was able to make it a closer game, but still lost 12-15. Another rematch against Virginia Tech ended similarly, losing 11-14, and the team ended Saturday 0-4, with a 10-15 loss to UNC Darkside and an 11-13 loss to regional rival Michigan. On a wet, cold, and windy Sunday, Illinois was not able to come out with any fire and lost badly to James Madison and Connecticut, going 0-6 on the weekend.</p>\n            <p>The final regular season tournament of the year was Huck Finn and the boys from Illinois looked to bounce back from a so far unsuccessful regular season. With a mindset of improving for the series the Illini came out with a 7-0 lead at half on Indiana and closed it out with an 11-4 win. Dayton was the next game, which was a 13-4 win for the Illini which meant that they would play Maryland for the pool. Ankle injuries to Prayag Patel and Ben Foster meant that the O line was playing without two key contributors, but the team was able to tough out a 14-11 win, setting up a crossover game against Illinois State. In a very windy game, Illinois triumphed over their in state competitors in a 10-6 victory, securing a quarterfinals berth. The team closed out the tournament with losses to Arkansas and Purdue, and prepared themselves for Conferences.</p>\n            <p>Once again, Rantoul was host to Conferences, but this time there could be no complaints about the weather. Illinois started out strong with comfortable wins over the rest of the pool, including an 11-4 victory over UChicago. Winning the pool lined up a semifinal game against Illinois State, which was won handily 13-7 and set up a classic Illinois - Northwestern rematch. Unfortunately, the team struggled to find the endzone and for the second year in a row, lost to Northwestern at Conferences. In the 2nd place match against UChicago, Illinois was unable to find a groove and lost 9-11. With Regionals in two weeks and only one bid for the region, Illinois had a lot of work to do.</p>\n            <p>In a change of pace, Regionals was not hosted in Rockford, but in Fair Oaks, Indiana. The conditions were terrible, low temperatures coupled with heavy wind and rain meant that it would be difficult getting a good grip. In the first game against Kentucky, both O and D line were able to perform well, giving up no breaks and handing out a few of their own and finishing with a score of 12-6. The trend continued against Indiana, with Illinois winning 13-6. Next up was Notre Dame, a rematch of last year’s finals, winner takes the pool and quarterfinals berth. A completely upwind/downwind game found the d line with opportunities to break, but never able to finish the job. With neither team being broken, Notre Dame won the flip and the game, 9-10. Illinois finished up the day with a 13-5 win over Michigan State to set up a quarterfinals matchup against Northwestern.</p>\n            <p>Conditions on Sunday were better and with a little support from Walden Nelson, the team was ready to avenge their recent losses. Illinois started on D and Northwestern came out with an break early in the game, but the team fought back and breaks were traded to have it be on serve at half. The second half commenced with more of a cleaner game, with both teams trading offensive holds. A chance at a break due to a Nick Pro sky was called back on a controversial observer ruling and the game reached softcap with the score 10-11. Chris Buchta tied up the score with a huck from Kevin Lin and the d line went out to try and break with the season on the line. After a turn from Northwestern, Illinois worked the disc down the field and rookie Jacob Cuthbert took a timeout outside of the endzone. One endzone set later, Prayag found Cuthbert for the win, sending Illinois to the semifinals.</p>\n            <p>Due to the loss in pool play, Illinois’s matchup in the semifinals was Michigan. Despite the tough game before, Illinois had to come out hot if they wanted to win the game. Michigan came out of the gate fast, scoring on a huck. Illinois followed suit, and the two teams traded offensive holds until Michigan broke for 3-5. As the game went on, the defensive pressure from Michigan intensified and Illinois’ o line was not able to match the goals that Michigan’s o line was putting out. Coming out of half at 5-8, Illinois turned and was broken again. A late injury to Prayag pushed the hope of a comeback a little further out of reach and a senior d line was unable to keep Michigan from seizing the victory 10-15. Michigan went on to defeat Notre Dame 15-9 to take the bid to Nationals. Illinois finished the season with a 11-10 victory over Purdue for 3rd in the region.</p>\n            <p>Captain Nick Prozorovsky and John Saniat received 1st team All-Region honors and Captain Prayag Patel received 2nd team All-Region. Ben Sabourin and Jacob Cuthbert were voted All-Freshmen for the region, with Ben winning Freshman of the Year.</p>\n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2015,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2015.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>After the worst regionals performance since 2006, Illinois entered the 2015 season with a new looking team and a new mindset. Major losses included long time coach Walden Nelson, as well as O-line stars Neal Phelps, Brian Rathunde, and Sean Hill. Marty Markenson returned as captain and was joined by first-timers Johnny Saniat and Nick Prozorovsky.</p>\n            <p>The major change to the team came in the form of returning coach, Matt Stupca. Matt coached the team from 2006-2009 and brought them to Nationals twice, finishing in 5th place in 2008. The experienced coach gave the team the necessary leadership needed to rebuild the club for a possible Nationals run again.</p>\n            <p>As always, the fall tryouts were competitive and exciting, with another strong rookie class and many B-teamers and outsiders joining the scene. When it was all said and done, the final roster consisted of 23 people. The roster included 2 rookies, 5 B-teamers, 15 returners, and 1 transfer student. New additions included Valparaiso stud, Matt West, basketball crossover Jarred Elliot, lovable spirit leader Eric Badger, and rookies Kevin Lin and Jacob Komenda.</p>\n            <p>Come end of fall, Illinois was re-armed and ready for another run for Nationals in the spring season.</p>\n            <p>The spring season schedule was perhaps one of Illinois' most busy. The team was scheduled to attend 3 of the highest level tournaments around the country, including tournaments in Texas, Florida, and South Carolina.</p>\n            <p>When February came around, it was time to head south to Tampa for the first spring tournament, Florida Warm-Up. For the first time, the team traveled by air to a tournament. Warm-Up, a three day tournament, proved to be a useful lesson to the team. On day one, the Illini went 1-3 with only one win in a night game vs. Cornell. It was a disappointing performance, but day two spelt different stories for Illinois. Saturday morning, The Illini would play the revered Nationals team UCF in a game that was recorded by Ultiworld. The Illini were no doubt underdogs, but fought hard to take a lead on the Dogs of War. Major plays included a Callahan by handler Prayag Patel and a huck break-score by Max Willis to rookie Jacob Komenda. The Dogs of War fought, but the Illini pulled through, winning the game 13-9 and claiming one of the biggest upsets of the tournament. Illinois would cruise to two more wins that day, finishing 3-0 for Saturday. With emotions high but legs tired, the Illini finished off the long weekend with a tough loss against Georgetown and a win against Wisconsin-Milwaukee on Sunday to end Florida Warm up. They finished 5-4 on the weekend.</p>\n            <p>The next big tournament was the famous Centex invite in Austin, Texas. The team was seeded 9th overall out of 20 after their impressive win against Central Florida back at Warm-Up. With high expectations, the Illini would jump right into it, playing one of the best teams of 2015, North-Carolina Wilmington. The first point of the game would prove to be somewhat of a theme for the Illini that weekend, as top cutter Nick Prozorovsky would go down with a knee injury. The Illini could not upset the big dog this time though, as Wilmington won comfortably at 11-3.</p>\n            <p>As the day went on, the injuries continued. Nearly half of the Illini squad would go down that day. The pain also showed in the scores, as the Illini would lose to Texas 12-5 and fall to two lower-seeded teams Arkansas and Iowa. They finished 0-4 on Saturday. </p>\n            <p>In the loser's bracket on Sunday, Illinois would go 3-0 with wins over California, Iowa State, and Wisconsin-Milwaukee. </p>\n            <p>The finale of the spring tournaments was the very competitive Easterns in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which a year earlier was won by Great Lakes region rival Michigan. The Illini went into the tournament with a bit of a different look, as Boomland coach Erik Huemiller would fill in for coach Matt Stupca as well as numerous injured and absent players returning to the squad. They were seeded as the 20 seed, with nowhere to go but up.</p>\n            <p>In a highly competitive pool, the Illini would start off against the 2012-2013 national champions, Pittsburgh. Pitt had won every tournament up to this point. The Illini took advantage of Pitts many sloppy mistakes, but could not come away with another upset, falling 15-10. The troubles continued, with losses to Carleton College, UMass, and Georgia. This put the Illini's first day record at a troubling 1-12 on the season.</p>\n            <p>Sunday would prove to be an important day for the Illini. Despite the troubles on Day 1s, the Illini had played well the second day of tournaments all season, with a 6-0 record. As the last ranked seed at the tournament, they would fight to break seed against NC State, Colorado State, and 10-seeded Auburn.</p>\n            <p>With many different position changes, the Illini came out with a new fire, going 3-0 again on Sunday and taking out the competition handily. With this, the Illini spring regular season would come to an end. They would finish with a 10-12 record, with only one of those wins coming on day one of a tournament. This issue would be in the back of everyone's head going into the postseason.</p>\n            <p>Sectionals, as always, was held in Rantoul, IL. The Illini came in as the favorite, with Northwestern and UChicago sitting close behind. The Illini would rough out wins against Eastern Illinois and Southern Illinois before taking on UChicago, who had ended their 2014 season dramatically last year at regionals.</p>\n            <p>The game was up and down but eventually ended in another crushing loss for the Illini on universe point. This sent the Illini into Sunday with a first round match against other rival Northwestern, who the team hadn't played since last year. The game was close early on, but the upstate rivals pulled ahead and eventually took the game 15-9. It was the second very alarming loss in a row for the Illini, and for the first time in years, would eliminate them from winning sectionals.</p>\n            <p>Despite this news, the Illini took down Illinois State in the next game to ensure another game against UChicago for second place in the section. In the game that had a game to go atmosphere, the Illini finally were able to hit on all cylinders, blowing out their recent rivals 15-6 and taking second place at sectionals. It would prove to be somewhat of a weight lifted off everyone's back going into regionals, but there was still much work to be done.</p>\n            <p>Regionals was back at Rockford, a place of many emotions for most Illinois players. Illinois came in as the 3 seed; in a pool with Purdue, Grand Valley, and again, UChicago. The recent ups and downs of the Illinois season, as well as inspiring messages by coach Stupca and some of the players, had the team focused as ever.</p>\n            <p>The first game against Purdue saw the O-Line in cruise control with a level of consistency not seen before in the season. With a few breaks mixed in, the Illini took the first game of the day 11-8. With an easier 13-6 win against Grand Valley State, Illinois would play their final game of the day against UChicago. The game was played just a few fields away from where Chicago ended Illinois season one year prior. Emotions ran high again, but the Illini finally put UChicago to rest in an 11-5 victory. It was a big statement for Illinois and sent them into Sunday's championship bracket riding high.</p>\n            <p>Illinois went into Sunday still not having been broken yet, a true testament to their O-line's improved focus. The first game of the day was against last year's second Nationals team from the region, Eastern Michigan. The game was tight throughout with both O-lines trading, but the Illini pulled through to win the game 15-12. The game saw the Illini let up one break, which was the first break allowed all weekend.</p>\n            <p>This sent the team into semis against their athletic, Big 10 counterparts, Indiana. Indiana, for the most part, was completely unfamiliar to the Illini's play style going into the matchup. With the 'game to go' in the back of everyone's heads, the Illini poured on the points and won 15-5, claiming their biggest victory of the tournament. The D-Line shined this game, giving the O-line a much needed rest heading into the biggest game of the season.</p>\n            <p>The 'game to go' saw the Illini face up against a team they never would have expected. In surprising fashion, the scrappy and energized Notre Dame would stand as their last test of the season. The other side of the bracket would prove to be one to remember, as Notre Dame had beaten rival Michigan after Michigan had beaten Northwestern on double game point the game before. It was win or go home for the Illini.</p>\n            <p>The game was a spectacle, with many of the program's alumni and half the region watching. And with expectations set on Nationals, the Illini delivered, winning the game 15-7 and punching their ticket to Milwaukee for Nationals.</p>\n            <p>The victory was a huge one for the program and it proved to be a huge swing in the eventual Coach of the Year award won by Illinois coach, Matt Stupca. Illinois ended the weekend 6-0, and unbelievably, only allowed 1 break all weekend.</p>\n            <p>The Illini were headed to Nationals!!!</p>\n            <p>After failing to reach Nationals the year earlier, Illinois returned and were seeded 19th among the competition. The Illini, having struggled against top competition earlier in the season, were highly focused going into Nationals.</p>\n            <p>Unusual circumstances at other regionals put the Illini in what was considered one of the best Nationals pools ever, Pool C. Their pool included Maryland, Oregon, Florida State, and UNC. Illinois had not played any of those teams during the regular season.</p>\n            <p>The first game was against Maryland, whose star player and Callahan nominee, was brothers with one of Illinois' rookies. The game was heated though, with highlights including a wild sky by Tyler 'Dutch' DeNooyer and a handblock of Maryland's star by Prayag Patel.</p>\n            <p>The game came down to the wire, but saw the Illini as the slim victors 15-13, with former Nationals scoring top-lister Nick Prozorovsky catching the final point to put the Illini 1-0 on the weekend. It was a win for the Illini that spoke volumes to the idea that they truly belonged there.</p>\n            <p>The next matchup was under the lights on the big field against UNC. Illinois faced another top level player, the eventual Callahan winner, Jon Nethercutt. Nethercutt and his UNC Darkside squad had been one of the highest ranked teams going into the tournament and looked even stronger with the return of the mighty cutter, Ben Snell. </p>\n            <p>Considered the underdogs by far, Illinois jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead, breaking the seemingly unstoppable UNC O-line. The early start proved to be important as Darkside fought back and took the half by only one point. The game was closer than anyone could have predicted.</p>\n            <p>But it was not enough to take down the Atlantic Coast champs, as Darkside took the game 15-12. Nethercutt proved to be hyped correctly, but the Illini still played strong regardless.</p>\n            <p>Day 2 saw the Illini in a huge spotlight, facing Oregon Ego to start the day. The road to Nationals had been shaky for Ego, as their struggles at regionals were the sole reason they had even been placed into Pool C as the shocking 15 seed. They sat 0-2 on the weekend, and were in a do-or-die situation for their season. Fittingly, the Illini matched up against them with a chance to end their season, and a chance to end the college career of one of the games' most well-known players, Dylan Freechild.</p>\n            <p>Freechild and the amped up Ego squad came out strong, taking an early and commanding lead. There were some glimmers of hope for Illinois, but none proved strong enough to get them close, as Ego won the game handily 15-7. This put the Illini at 1-2, and kept the season alive for Oregon.</p>\n            <p>The final game of pool play came against Chris Laroque and Florida State. A year earlier, Illinois had lost a tough game on double game point against FSU at Easterns. Illinois yet again was a heavy underdog. They managed to keep it close for most the game, but FSU's star-studded team proved too strong as FSU took the game 15-11. It was another game very close at half for Illinois, which was promising. The loss would put Illinois out of contention to move into the next round of play.</p>\n            <p>In the final game of the season, Illinois would play Cincinnati. With a win, they would claim a tie for 13th place. With a loss, they would finish 17th at Nationals for the 5th time in a row, perhaps proving the 'curse of Illinois-th place' to be true.</p>\n            <p>But the Illini had no plans to settle for that, as they took the game 15-12 with a bit of a late surge. The game proved to be an Illini classic, with a goal line D by Mark Peterson and a bookends point from Kanzy. The win was topped off with Nick Prozorovsky catching the game winning catch, sending the fans home happy and ending an excellent Illinois season.</p>\n            <p>Illinois broke the 'curse' and finished 13th, their best Nationals performance since 2008.</p>\n            <p>Not surprisingly, three of the final four teams were from Pool C, and the championship saw UNC match up against Oregon. UNC would win again, blowing out Oregon 15-6. In the end, it was actually Illinois who had put the most points up on the eventual champions, with 12 points. Nick Prozorovsky finished pool play tied for the lead in goals scored at 24. Most importantly, Illinois broke seed, gaining the respect deserved and achieving their goals. The 13 seniors leaving were sent home happy.</p>\n            <p>Matt West and Nick Prozorovsky won 1st team all region honors. Kevin Lin won Freshman of the Region. The Matt Stupca deservedly won Coach of the year.</p>\n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2014,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2014.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>Illinois entered the season hoping to return to Nationals.

The captaining team was young and inexperienced but Walden Nelson returned giving the team hope.</p>\n            <p>At MLC the team was able to exceed expectations by finishing in 2nd place, losing to the eventual National Champions Colorado Mamabird in the finals. This win in addition to the previous year's nationals birth gave the team a cockiness they were unable to shed.</p>\n            <p>The spring schedule was a weak one compared to years' past. The team only attended two tournaments, Huck Finn and Easterns. The team was able to easily win Kat Fight which further boosted the team's ego. At Easterns they fell short in Pool play losing to Pitt, Florida State, Luther, and Central Florida. But won 13th place with wins against Massachusetts and Luther.</p>\n            <p>Illinois was able to comfortable win the Illinois Conference Championships with a win in the finals over Northwestern. The Great Lakes earned two bids to nationals thanks to Northwestern and Michigan. Illinois won their pool and set themselves up for a shot at Nationals. Northwestern learned from their Conference loss and was able to adapt to slow down the Illinois offense forcing Illinois to fight through the backdoor. They next played Chicago in a windy game in which both teams attempted to score with 50/50 shots. These conditions stopped Illinois' high speed offense and gave Chicago a chance to have many opportunities on defense. Chicago finally finished the game with a stall 9 jump ball in the endzone finishing Illinois' season.</p>\n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2013,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2013.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>After the disappointing and heartbreaking finish in 2012, Illinois lost a huge chunk of veteran talent and had to reload for 2013. Ryan Smith was captain for the 3rd year in a row and was joined by three first year captains in Neal Phelps, Colin Reid and Nathan Gibbons. The captains and the seniors on the team used the previous year's finish as motivation and set the tone at practices throughout the whole year.</p>    \n            <p>Tryouts were completed shockingly early for the 2nd year in a row. With so many open spots, Illinois was fortunate to receive a very deep and talented freshman class. Five freshman made the A-team, with three of them all coming from the same high school. A large chunk of the team were stepping into new roles or were new to college ultimate altogether. They would be forced to acclimate and adjust quickly if Illinois were to meet it's goals for the year.</p>    \n            <p>At Huck Finn, Illinois came in very over confident and were punished by the frisbee gods for their hubris. They thought they could walk into the tournament and do well. They got a huge wake up call on Saturday with three losses including a potential candidate for worst loss of the program. Another blemish on Coach Walden Nelson's coaching record. Illinois used their performance on Saturday of Huck Finn as cause for penance and toughed out an undefeated Sunday through atrocious weather conditions.</p>    \n            <p>The next weekend at Centex, Illinois came out with a renewed focus and sense of urgency. They gritted out a semifinals finish including splitting two universe point games against Harvard. This tournament gave people on the team reason to believe and showed what the team was capable of.</p>    \n            <p>Sectionals was held in Chicago. There were some tough games, but Illinois won their third consecutive conference championship. After winning the tournament, Illinois did hill sprints to help get mentally prepared for the bloodbath of a 1 bid region.</p>    \n            <p>Illinois came into Regionals as the #2 seed and knew what they had to do. Just like 2011, the format was pool play on Saturday with bracket play on Sunday. The first two games were comfortable victories. The third pool play game against Indiana was a back and forth affair. Indiana led late in the game, but on long turn-filled universe point, Illinois ground out a tough win.</p>    \n            <p>Sunday morning, Illinois came out very hot and played extremely well in a good win over up and coming Northwestern. In the first half of the Regional semi-final against MSU, Illinois could not continue their good play. The Oline struggled mightily with execution errors from the younger players on the line. The first half score was 5-8 MSU. Early in the second half, this worrying trend continued and the score went to 6-10 MSU. When things were looking dire, the soon to be graduating players refused to go down without a fight. Big plays from Preston Goulson and Tyler Anderson fueled a furious Illinois comeback highlighted by a big sky from Brian Rathunde. Illinois pulled out a stunning 14-11 win over MSU. This set up the classic Great Lake Regionals matchup between Illinois and Michigan. For the first time since 2008, this matchup would be for the Regional title and the sole bid to Nationals. Illinois maintained a very slim lead throughout the game. The Oline played very calmly even with increased pressure from Michigan. Late in the game, Illinois pulled out a couple breaks and ended the game on a d and subsequent score by Jon McKoy. Illinois returned to Nationals as the sole representative of the Great Lakes. Ryan Smith won Player of the Region honors, Neal Phelps, Nathan Gibbons earned First Team All-Region awards, Brad Bolliger earned a Second Team and Nick Prozorovsky, Johnny Saniat and Derek Yan earned Freshman team awards.</p>    \n            <p>Unfortunately at Nationals, Illinois could not break the 17th place curse. Some key players were unable to play. Illinois gamely tried to fight on but just could not overcome their depleted personnel. In a unsurprising turn of events, Illinois finished 17th at Nationals.</p>    \n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2012,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2012.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>For the first time since 2008, Illinois returned a majority of the team and had high expectations going into the season. Major personnel losses included 2-time captain Austin Lien and 3-year O-line starter Chris Hidaka. Zach Frantz and Ryan Smith returned as captains and were joined by Kevin Bruns. With such a large number of returning A-teamers, tryouts were as competitive as ever and there were many people fighting for the few remaining spots. After following the Illinois tradition of making final cuts really late, 3 freshmen had made the A-team, which hadn't happened since 2009.</p>    \n            <p>For such a veteran team, focus and urgency was lacking during the season. There were many times where people would be going through the motions and not getting the most of the practice. Unlike past years, when the senior class would set the tone for all their younger teammates, this year saw a rift open up between the seniors and the younger members of the team. This rift manifested itself in many ways throughout the season, but it came to a head at Centex where a team meeting was held Saturday night after pool play and two juniors spoke to all the seniors and told them to get their act together.</p>    \n            <p>With high expectations going into the season, Illinois scheduled a more competitive tournament schedule than in 2011 and went to Easterns and Centex two tournaments with several Nationals contenders in addition to the early season tournament Free State Classic. With all the drama going on behind closed doors, Illinois had an up and down tournament performance with some uncharacteristic big losses. At Free State, Illinois struggled to play in the wind against Iowa and lost to them twice, once on Saturday and again in the Final. At Centex, Illinois played Iowa again and came out hot and took a 3-0 lead, but that quickly disappeared and Iowa won again in dominating fashion. This bled into the most dispiriting performance by Illinois in many years, as they proceeded to be blanked in the first half by Tufts. After play ended, the aforementioned team meeting was held. Sunday of Centex, Illinois came out reinvigorated and played a close game with Luther but eventually lost on universe. The following weekend at Easterns, Illinois played much more consistently and lost twice, once to eventual champions Pittsburgh and again on universe to Tufts. Buoyed by their Easterns results, Illinois looked ahead to the series and a return to Nationals.</p>    \n            <p>The third annual alumni game was held, and the alumni extended their winning streak to two games after a dismal performance by the college kids. After taking half 8-5, the college team seemed to think the game was over and did not try as hard as the older, more out of shape alumni. Unfortunately, the lessons from the alumni game would not be remembered later in the season.</p>    \n            <p>Sectionals once again were held in Rantoul and like every other tournament that has ever been held there, the weather was terrible. Saturday was cold, windy, and wet and Illinois took care of business winning every game handily. Sunday was sunny and very windy and after going up by a lot on Northwestern, Illinois lost their focus and let them back into the game. Illinois eventually closed it out and won by a few points.</p>    \n            <p>Like the past three years, Illinois was counting on being able to flip the switch and play their best ultimate of the season at Regionals. With two bids to Nationals, the best format and Regionals being held in Naperville, confidence was very high that Illinois would be able to get the job done and qualify for Nationals. It was a cold, windy, wet day on Saturday but Illinois won their first game comfortably. In a shocking turn of events, a lack of focus caused Illinois to come out flat against Eastern Illinois in the regional quarterfinals. Eastern Illinois came out and punched in four breaks in a row. Illinois fought back and tied the score at 5-5, but they could never get over the hump and take the lead. Eastern Illinois' Michael Schwenk carried the team to an upset with a 13-10 victory and gave Illinois their first loss at Regionals since 2008.</p>    \n            <p>With their backs against the wall, Illinois regrouped and took care of business on Saturday and stayed alive in the 2nd place bracket for Sunday. For the first time since 2007, Illinois was not in the Regional Final Sunday morning but instead in a fight for their season in the backdoor semi- finals. They dispatched Indiana 15-7 and had a rematch with Eastern Illinois in the backdoor final. Illinois did not take them lightly this time and came out with a rarely seen intensity and beat Eastern 15-2. However, the team's focus and execution was not there and multiple turnovers on every point culminated in the destruction of Coach Walden Nelson's clipboard. Illinois, after an arduous road, had finally made it to a game to go to Nationals against Michigan State. Illinois started the game out strong and fired up and came out with two quick breaks. MSU played a lot of zone in an effort to negate Ryan Smith's hucks. But Ryan did not take the bait and lead the offense to a clean no break first half and the defense got 3 breaks for an 8-5 halftime lead. Illinois smelled a Nationals berth and came out of half with 2 more points for a commanding 10-5 lead. This was when Michigan State held their ground and began a tenacious comeback. Staying with their zone, MSU began to force more and more turnovers from Illinois and began to convert them for breaks. A 10-5 lead quickly became 10-8 and MSU clawed slowly back from there to finally take the lead at 13-12. A lot of credit is to be given to MSU for never giving up and fighting their way back to the lead. But Illinois' lack of composure on offense coupled with a willingness to turn the disc over, as well as timeout mismanagement by Coach Walden Nelson did not help the cause. Even with all that being said, Illinois scored on offense to make it 13- 13 universe point with the winner going to Nationals. Illinois got the disc twice on universe and both times threw passes into the endzone that hit a receiver's hands, but alas both passes were dropped. After the second drop in the endzone MSU picked up the disc and immediately threw an 80 yard, more than full field huck for the game and the Nationals berth.</p>    \n            <p>This was not the ending to the 2012 season that Illinois imagined. For the first time since 2007, Illinois' graduating seniors did not get to end their careers at Nationals. With a huge graduating class, it will be up to the few returning A-teamers to pick up the pieces and return Illinois to Nationals.</p>    \n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2011,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2011.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>The program lost several program mainstays such as 5-year A-teamer and 2-time captain Brian Phelan, Top 10 Callahan finisher and captain Walden Nelson, and Team Spirit Leader Kurt Zoellick among others. This required the large junior class to step up and meet the challenge. Juniors Zachary Frantz and Ryan Smith stepped up to become captains alongside returning captain Austin Lien. The captains surveyed the tryout pool and saw that it was one of the most competitive in recent history. Wanting to give everyone a fair look, final cuts weren't made until the end of January. After the smoke cleared, the final roster stood at 27 and after a 1 year hiatus of no freshman making the cut, 2 freshman found themselves on the team.</p>\n            <p>Even with a full roster, Illinois battled the injury bug throughout the season. Dline handler Adam Wright tore his acl at Rivalry Reheat and only returned for a few points at Nationals. Captain Zachary Frantz battled Plantar Fasciitis the whole year, missing every tournament besides Regionals and Nationals. 5th year cutter Chris Hidaka badly sprained his ankle in the 2nd game of the first tournament and never quite regained his old form. Seniors Suleyman Ahmad and Jonathan Hatcher had leg problems of their own and were in and out of the line up. Junior Ryan Kurnik broke his hand and missed the last half of the season. In addition there were numerous other injuries that kept people away from the field.</p>\n            <p>However there were still tournaments to be played and games to be won. Compared to past years, Illinois traveled to less competitive tournaments. Unfortunately this did not lead to more victories as Illinois struggled to maintain focus for whole games, often playing one good and one bad half. There were some benefits as several players were able to gain much needed experience playing new and more challenging roles than they were accustomed to. Illinois made semifinals of both the Freestate Classic and Huck Finn before losing to Central Region teams Iowa and Minnesota. Going into the series, Illinois hoped to follow the trends of the past two Illinois teams and play their best ultimate during the series.</p>\n            <p>Sectionals was held close by in Rantoul, Illinois as people still didn't get the memo not to have tournaments there in the Spring. Saturday was a windy and rainy day, Illinois took care of business and won every game by a comfortable margin. On Sunday, buoyed by the rare beautiful Rantoul weather, Illinois beat Northwestern and Eastern Illinois to repeat as Sectional Champions.</p>\n            <p>Just like 2010, Illinois had the 3rd seed going into Regionals. Unlike past years only 1 team would make it to Nationals, meaning 1 bad half and the season would be over. Another change was the format, with the format being pool play instead of a straight bracket. In a very windy Saturday, Illinois gutted out a close game against Loyola, winning on double game point. After that scare woke them up, they beat Western Michigan and Notre Dame handily. Everyone on the team was looking forward to facing Michigan in semis but first they would have to get through Indiana in the first game of the day on Sunday. Led by their senior leaders Ed Wu and Taylor Kraemer, Indiana gave Illinois all they could handle in a close back and forth game before Illinois pulled it out winning 15-13. This led to the semifinal showdown with Michigan for the third year in a row. However, this year would be different from the past two years as Illinois came out firing with an intensity that Michigan either could not or was unwilling to match. It was a total team effort as everyone contributed to a resounding 15-9 win. It was a great win, but people were too satisfied with that victory considering that the bid to Nationals was still up for grabs. Illinois still had to face a determined opponent in Michigan State who undoubtedly had plans for revenge from 2010. Fortunately for Illinois, Michigan State had several unforced errors in the first half of the game and Illinois took advantage going up several breaks in the first half. Michigan State tried to mount a comeback in the second half but the score difference was too great. Illinois won the region for the 3rd year in a row and took the regions only bid to Nationals with a 15-11 victory. Illinois had several players who played well during Regionals including but not limited to Dane Jorgensen, Brian Pierce, Austin Lien, Zachary Frantz, Ryan Smith and Neal Phelps. In a surprising turn of events, only Ryan Smith was a member of the All-Region team.</p>\n            <p>Going into Nationals, Illinois planned on breaking the curse of two straight 17th places. Ironically enough and deservedly so, Illinois had the 17th seed going in. Illinois was in a pool with overall #1 seed Pittsburgh and #12 seed and fan favorite Colorado College. In the first game of Nationals against Colorado College, Illinois battled nerves and had several unforced errors in the first half. However, led by Neal Phelps' stellar defense on Callahan candidate Nicky Spiva and Dane Jorgensen's aerial ability, Illinois fought and clawed back for a gritty 13-11 victory. This was Illinois' first Nationals pool play victory in 2 years and had them primed to take a spot in prequarters. After losing 15-10 to Pittsburgh highlighted by a break with several Nationals first timers and both rookies, Illinois only needed to win 1 of their next 2 games to take a spot in prequarters. Unfortunately, the issues that beguiled Illinois throughout the season came up once again. To put it simply, Illinois did not show up on Saturday of Nationals. Illinois looked lifeless and lost to Iowa 15-10. Even with that being said, Illinois simply had to win against Tufts to advance to the bracket. With their season on the line, Illinois gave a sad, disappointing effort both on the field and on the sidelines. Their effort was no where close to good enough and they got punished deservedly, 15-7, knocking them into the placement bracket for the 3rd year in a row. Illinois lost to Whitman 16-14 after leading most of the game and then in the game they have never lost, beat Florida and took 17th place for the 3rd year in a row.

The captains Brian Phelan, Walden Nelson and Austin Lien, had to come to terms with the responsibilities and extra work that Matt Stupca provided, and carry a bigger load themselves. Dealing with the heavy losses from the year before, Illinois called up a number of players from the B-team and two from the C-team which was a program first. Illinois spent much of the season acclimating the new players so that they would be ready for Nationals level competition.</p>\n            <p>They had uneven results and growing pains throughout the year, with a highlight being making the finals of Mardis Gras before losing to Wisconsin by a substantial margin. It also included another shellacking by Michigan at Huck Finn as many players got their first taste of the regional rivalry. Illinois had several injuries throughout the year which made practice attendance an issue, however Illinois fought through them and went into the College Series mostly healthy.</p>\n            <p>At Sectionals Illinois held the 1 seed going in, but lost on Saturday of Sectionals for the first time since the Regions and Sections were redrawn. This gave them a 2 seed out of their pool and a first round match up with Notre Dame the 2 seed overall, with good seeding at Regionals on the line. Illinois went up big early but Notre Dame made a furious comeback to tie up late in the game, Illinois received going upwind and threw caution into the wind by throwing several close throws through and around the Notre Dame zone before punching it in and winning 14-13. Illinois then took care of business and made it to finals, exacting revenge on Purdue for the Saturday loss and beating them 15-5 and reclaiming the Sectional title.</p>\n            <p>Going into Regionals Illinois had the 3 seed going in behind Michigan State and Michigan. Illinois beat both Dayton and Purdue handily and advanced to semifinals before finding out that Regionals would be postponed for a week. Having a week to prepare and to heal, Illinois faced Michigan at Regionals as is the norm. In a heavy wind game, which saw several lead changes, but few breaks, and lots of great plays from both teams, Illinois was able to score on a gut-wrenching universe point and won the game 9-8.</p>\n            <p>This sent Illinois to its 3rd straight Regional final with a chance to repeat as Regional champions for the first time in the programs history. Illinois faced Michigan State with the Regional title on the line and prevailed in a close game with Illinois being able to pull away in the end, 15-10. Illinois repeated as Regional champions for the first time and had Brian Phelan and Walden Nelson win first team All-Region honors and had Ryan Smith win 2nd team All-Region, becoming the first sophomore in the programs history to win a regional award. Illinois was seeded 14th going into Nationals. They lost to Harvard handily but was still in contention for a prequarters berth if they were able to beat both UNCW and Iowa. However, in games possibly showing a lack of experience or the burden of captaining and coaching proving too great, Illinois lost late leads in both games and lost to UNCW 14-12 and to Iowa 16-14. Illinois then played Carleton in a much closer than expected 15-12 loss and lost to Wisconsin. Beating Kansas in the last game of the tournament gave Illinois its only win at Nationals and sent them home with another 17th place finish. Illinois did not graduate as many players as in years past, which makes Illinois in a prime position to continue its Nationals qualifying streak.</p>\n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2009,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2009.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>2009 saw the departures of many fixtures of the Illinois program such as Joel Koehneman, Pat Stephens, Jake Segil and David Abram. In their place it was up to the class of 2005 to step up and lead the program. It was the first time in several years that there were 3 captains vacancies. They were filled by Denis Agniel, Brian Phelan and Charlie O'Brien. Like in 2006 when the team lost several impact players, the team was able to recruit a very deep class that rivals and may surpass the freshman class of 2006. This influx of freshman led to the 2nd year of the C- teams existence in the programs history.</p>    \n            <p>The regular season for Illinois was very rough, with the team trying to find people who would be able to fill the big holes left by the departed players. This led to several big losses throughout the year and poor tournament finishes, culminating in a 13-2 beatdown by regional rival Michigan at Huck Finn. Going into the postseason/the college series, Illinois had a lot of uncertainty. At Sectionals, Illinois took care of business on Saturday and beat a tough North Park team in semifinals and made Finals against Notre Dame. In a rainy, cold final, Illinois looked like they did throughout the season and lost 15-10. This gave Illinois a 4 seed going into Regionals and a definite longshot for one of the two Nationals bids.</p>\n            <p>Illinois faced tougher than expected games against Kenyon and North Park before meeting Michigan in Regional semifinals. Illinois came together in a way that had not been seen all season, and put forth their best effort of the season and beat Michigan in a tense hard fought game 12-9. This put Illinois in its second straight Regional final against Ohio State. The previous day's momentum carried over as Illinois beat Ohio State handily 15-11, taking home its first Regional championship since 2002.</p>\n            <p>Illinois placed Denis Agniel, Brian Phelan, Pavan Sarguru, and Walden Nelson on the Great Lakes 2nd Team All-Region, Coach Matt Stupca won the inaugural Coach of the Region award, and Ryan Smith won Freshman of the year. Winning the Region gave Illinois an 8 seed going into Nationals, however whatever magic Illinois had at Regionals was lost at Nationals, as Illinois lost several games by big margins except for one close pool play game against Tufts and the only win against Cal. They did so in good spirit, winning the 2009 Nationals Spirit Award and dubbed Zubair: The most spirited man in ultimate. Although, this performance gave Illinois a disappointing 17th place finish at Nationals and with several players graduating including captain Denis Agniel, the prospect of another rebuilding year loomed large.</p>\n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2008,\n        imagePath: './assets/team-photo-2008.jpg',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>Using the loss at Regionals the previous year as motivation and determined to make Nationals in captains Joel Koehneman, Pat Stephans and David Abrams, final year. Many players on the team spent their summer and fall, going to tournaments together in an effort to get better. Illinois also got a key transfer student Denis Agniel, who created the team at Loyola University in Chicago. This was a very veteran team under coach Matt Stupca that was poised to make a run into Nationals.</p>    \n            <p>Throughout the season, Illinois had a chance to win every game that they played. The biggest margin of victory in Illinois' losses heading into Regionals was 3 points. Illinois suffered some key injuries before Sectionals but managed to persevere and hold of North Park in an exciting 17-16 Sectional Final. Like the previous year Illinois had a 2 seed going into Regionals. They took care of business on Saturday winning all 3 games and securing a spot in the Regional finals. In many people's first Regional final, Illinois played tentatively and lost 15-11 to Michigan putting them in the 2nd place game against Ohio State. In a reversal of the previous years game at Regionals, Illinois stormed out to a big lead and maintained it throughout and punched their first ticket to Nationals in 3 years.</p>    \n            <p>Pat Stephens and Joel Koehneman both won all-region honors. Nationals that year was in Boulder, Colorado and Illinois went into it holding an 8 seed and in a pool with Florida, North Texas and Delaware. Illinois beat Delaware to clinch a spot in prequarters, and lost to Florida and North Texas. In prequarters Illinois was matched up against Michigan, who they had lost to at Regionals and had not beaten since 2004. In a hard fought game led by the graduating players, Illinois prevailed 15-11 sending them into quarters against the hometown team Colorado. In an exciting game that saw several big plays, Illinois lost 15-12 to Colorado and ended their season having them tied for 5th which is the highest finish in the programs history. 2008 saw the departure of many mainstays for Illinois and the following years would show how well the recruiting efforts of 2005 paid off.</p>      \n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2007,\n        imagePath: '',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>Coming off of one the worst years in recent history, Illinois started to put the pieces in place to make a run at a Nationals berth. The leadership which added Jake Segil as a captain, joining Joel Koehneman and Brian Korbesmeyer and Matt Stupca as coach, continued to focus on recruiting, resulting in an another big influx of freshman. Resulting in the creation of the first C-team in the programs history. However, unlike the previous year, many of them stopped playing within a year.</p>    \n            <p>In order to gear up to make a run and to face stiffer competition, Illinois designed a much harder tournament schedule travelling to tournaments in Las Vegas and Austin, in addition to ones they had previously gone to in Baton Rouge and Atlanta. This benefited the team, as they were able to match up and see where they stood in relation to both Nationals finalists. As a result, the team was able to see that they were more than prepared to take a Nationals berth out of Regionals.</p>    \n            <p>Illinois steamrolled through Sectionals and reclaimed the Sectionals crown and had a 2-seed going into Regionals. Regionals was held in Rantoul, Illinois and was hosted by Illinois. Illinois took care of business early, beating Dayton and Notre Dame handily before squaring off against Indiana in Regional semifinals. In a very heavy upwind downwind game that saw very few breaks, Illinois received going downwind on universe point but was unable to punch it in and lost on a couple floaty upwind hucks. Out of the running for first, Illinois was now in the backdoor bracket having to win every game in order to advance to Nationals. They beat Northwestern and faced Ohio State, the #1 seed going into the tournament who had also lost in semis to Michigan. Perhaps showing a little bit of inexperience in a pressure filled game, Illinois went down big early, going down 5-0, however, they mounted a furious comeback and came close to negating the early deficit, but eventually succumbed 15-12 and ending their season without a Nationals berth for the 3rd year in a row. Illinois finished 4th at Regionals.</p>    \n            <p>Brian Korbesmeyer and Joel Koehneman both received all-region honors. However unlike the previous year, there were several graduating players most notably Brian Korbesmeyer, who had captained the team the previous 2 years and was a major player on offense. Finding players to step into the holes left by the graduating players was a major question going into the next year.</p>    \n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2006,\n        imagePath: '',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>After coming so close to a Nationals berth the year before, 2006 was a rebuilding year for Illinois. After losing several starting players, the captains, Brian Korbesmeyer and Joel Koehneman and coach Matt Stupca, decided to focus their energies on recruiting and replenishing the program. This led to one of the deepest freshman classes in the programs history largely due to the efforts of Brian Korbesmeyer. In order to facilitate the rebuilding process, the leadership decided to go with a very small A-team roster of less than 20 guys, so that everyone would be able to play both on the A-team and on the B-team. The B-team with the services of coach Nick McDuffee was able to nurture the players and have them ready to take the next step onto the A-team. It was a season with very few bright spots, as Illinois did not make the Sectional final for one of the few times in modern history, finishing 4th at Sectionals, and did not even make Sunday of Regionals, finishing tied for 7th after losing in quarterfinals and getting eliminated in the backdoor bracket. However, there were encouraging signs for future years to come, Brian Phelan won freshman of the year for the Great Lakes Region and there were several talented players waiting in the wings, ready to make their mark on the program and the same core of players returning.</p>    \n        `\n    },\n    {\n        year: 2005,\n        imagePath: '',\n        summaryMarkup: `\n            <p>Illinois advanced to the finals at Regionals and lost to Michigan on double game point, and had to immediately play Michigan State for second place and the chance to return to nationals.

From there we maintained our lead up to 13-12. Michigan worked the disc upwind and called a timeout 5 yards out of the endzone on the forehand side.

Illinois set the goal of qualifying for Regionals, and at that time the Central Region included every state from Minnesota to Illinois to Colorado.
